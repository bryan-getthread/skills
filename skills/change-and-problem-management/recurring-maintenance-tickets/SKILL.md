# Recurring Maintenance Tickets

Recurring maintenance is a promise on a schedule, usually a contractual one. Two failure modes eat it: cycles closed with a bare "done" (no evidence the work happened), and cycles that silently never open. This skill audits both — evidence per cycle, continuity across cycles.

## When to use

- "Audit last month's maintenance tickets" / "did the monthly server maintenance actually happen?"
- A periodic hygiene sweep over all recurring maintenance series.
- Before a client review where maintenance delivery will be claimed.
- A recurring ticket was closed suspiciously fast and a lead wants it checked.

## Steps

1. Identify the recurring series in scope: search_tickets for the maintenance tickets over the audit window (by title pattern, board, or type — recurring series are usually recognizable by repeated titles on a cadence). Group tickets into their series (same title pattern + client).
2. **Per-cycle evidence check** — for each closed cycle, grade the completion evidence in descending strength:
   - STRONG: specific findings recorded (what was checked, what was found, values/counts — "verified last 30 backup jobs, 2 failures remediated, ticket <ref>"), plus time logged consistent with the work.
   - WEAK: a generic completion phrase that would be identical every month ("maintenance completed, all good") with time logged. Interchangeable notes across cycles are the signature of checkbox theater — flag when a series' last N closure notes are near-identical.
   - NONE: closed with no note or a bare status flip. Grade it NONE and say so; a closed ticket proves closure, not maintenance.
   Ticket data can prove documentation, not work — the grades are about evidence, and the report says exactly that.
3. **Corroborate where possible**: when the maintenance touches RMM-managed devices and NinjaOne is enabled, check device activity history (get_ninjaone_device_activities) for actions consistent with the claimed window (patch events, reboots, maintenance mode). Corroboration upgrades confidence; its absence is noted, not damning (much real maintenance leaves no RMM trace). Skip gracefully when no RMM is connected.
4. **Skipped-cycle check** — the continuity audit: from each series' cadence (evident from its history), verify a ticket exists for every expected cycle in the window. Missing cycle → flag with the last-completed date ("monthly server review for <client>: no ticket for <month>; last completed <date>"). Also catch the degraded forms: cycles opened but never touched, and cycles closed the same minute they opened.
5. Report per series: cycles expected / opened / closed, evidence grades, corroboration results, skipped cycles, and a trend call (healthy / degrading / theater). Route findings: weak-evidence habits to the lead as coaching data; skipped cycles to whoever owns the schedule (and if the series comes from a broken automation, say so — the fix is the generator, not the tech).
6. On request, post a plain-text audit note on each flagged ticket stating what evidence is missing, so the assigned tech can remediate the record while memory is fresh.

## Guardrails

- Honesty about proof limits is the core of this skill: closed ≠ done, a note ≠ the work, and the report never claims maintenance "happened" — it grades the evidence that it did.
- Never backfill or upgrade evidence on anyone's behalf; the agent flags gaps, humans supply the missing record or own the miss.
- Do not reopen or close tickets in the audit pass — findings are notes and reports; state changes are the owner's call.
- Identical-note detection is a flag, not a verdict — some maintenance genuinely is routine; the tech gets asked, not accused.
- Result-cap honesty: capped searches mean possible missed cycles are reported as "unable to verify," not "skipped."

## Unattended (Flows) variant

- Trigger: a recurring maintenance ticket transitions to closed, or a scheduled sweep at cycle end.
- Deterministic rule: grade the closing evidence per step 2. STRONG or WEAK-with-time-logged → do nothing (no note, no reply). NONE (no closure note, or closed within minutes of opening with no time logged) → the entire reply is one plain-text internal note: "Maintenance closure check: this recurring ticket was closed without completion evidence (no findings note / no time entry). Please add what was checked and found, per the maintenance standard." Nothing else.
- Never reopen the ticket, never change status, never message the client unattended.
- When series membership or the evidence grade is ambiguous, do nothing. Do not post if an identical evidence-check note already exists on the ticket.
