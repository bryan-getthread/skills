# Incident Commander Brief

A live major incident changes hands — new IC at shift change, escalation to a senior lead, or the first IC finally taking a break. This brief is the takeover package: state, not story. It's built from the master incident ticket's timeline and linked workstreams, and it's honest about what's unknown.

## When to use

- "Brief me — I'm taking over as IC" / "hand the incident to <lead>."
- Shift change during a long-running major (pair with shift-handoff in escalation for the rest of the queue).
- An executive or senior engineer joining mid-incident needs the current state fast.
- The current IC wants a written checkpoint of where things stand (also useful evidence later).

## Steps

1. Load the master incident ticket and every linked workstream/child ticket (search_tickets): full notes in time order, status transitions, role assignments from the declaration (major-incident-declaration).
2. Build the brief in this fixed order — an incoming IC should be able to stop reading after any section and still be net better off:
   - **Situation, 3 lines**: what's broken, who's affected (clients/users/sites), current severity trend (improving / stable / degrading) with the evidence for that trend.
   - **Next decision point** — up top, not buried: the decision the IC will face soonest, when it's due, and the options as currently understood (e.g. "vendor ETA expires 14:00 — extend the workaround or start failover; failover takes 2h and is one-way until tonight").
   - **Timeline** — compressed to inflection points: detection, declaration, each mitigation attempted and its result, cause hypotheses raised and eliminated. Timestamps from ticket records; anything reconstructed is marked "approx." Not every note — the turns.
   - **Workstreams** — per stream: owner, current action, last update time, blocked/unblocked. A stream with no update in over an hour is flagged as "stale — verify before relying on this."
   - **Comms state** — last internal update sent (when, gist), last client update sent (when, gist), next update due per the cadence (incident-comms-cadence), and any commitment already made to a client (a promised ETA is a decision constraint the new IC inherits).
   - **Resources** — who's engaged and for how long (fatigue is operational data), which vendor cases are open with case numbers from the ticket, who's on deck.
   - **Known unknowns** — what has NOT been established yet, stated plainly. The brief's credibility rests on this section.
3. Deliver in chat to the incoming IC; post the brief as a plain-text note on the master ticket (add_ticket_note) marked "IC handover brief — <from> to <to>, <time>" so the handover itself is on the timeline.
4. If the ticket record is too thin to build a trustworthy brief (gaps over an hour during active response), say so explicitly and list the gaps — the outgoing IC fills them verbally and the brief records that they were filled verbally.

## Guardrails

- State only what the ticket evidence supports; label hypothesis as hypothesis. A wrong "confirmed" in an IC brief steers the whole response wrong.
- The brief never makes the pending decision — it frames it. The IC decides.
- Include commitments made to clients verbatim where possible; paraphrasing a promised ETA is how ETAs get accidentally re-promised.
- No blame framing in-flight ("the change that caused this") — causal language stays neutral until the post-mortem (post-mortem-rca-author) settles it.
- If information is stale or capped (search limits, missing workstream notes), the brief says so rather than presenting a partial picture as complete.
