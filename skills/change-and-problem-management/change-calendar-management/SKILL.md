# Change Calendar Management

The change calendar is three overlapping calendars — the MSP's scheduled changes, each client's freeze windows, and each client's business rhythm — and a proposed window has to clear all three. This skill runs that clearance and schedules (or bounces) the change.

## When to use

- "Can we do this Saturday night?" / "find a window for this change."
- A change was approved and needs its window placed on the calendar.
- A weekly sweep of upcoming scheduled changes for newly-introduced conflicts.
- Two teams independently scheduled work on the same system (this skill is why you find out early).

## Steps

1. Load the change ticket: affected systems, affected clients, proposed window, expected duration including rollback time. A window that fits the change but not change-plus-rollback is not a fitting window.
2. **Freeze check**: look up each affected client's freeze calendar (search_knowledge_base; see maintenance-freeze-windows for how these are recorded). A window inside a freeze is an automatic bounce to the requester with the freeze cited — the exception path lives in maintenance-freeze-windows, not here.
3. **Business-calendar check**: compare the window against the client's documented operating hours and known busy periods (month-end close, seasonal peaks, published events). "Saturday night" is not universally safe — some clients run weekends. If operating hours are not documented, say so and ask rather than assuming 9-to-5.
4. **Collision check**: search_tickets for other approved or scheduled changes overlapping the window on the same systems, the same client, or shared infrastructure in the dependency path. Flag both hard collisions (same system, overlapping window) and soft ones (same client hit by two unrelated maintenances in one week — that reads as instability to the client even when each change is fine).
5. Render a verdict: CLEAR (all three checks pass), CONFLICT (cite each conflict specifically), or INSUFFICIENT (missing duration, undocumented client hours — list what's needed).
6. On CLEAR and with the requester's confirmation, place the window with schedule_ticket (or update_schedule_entry when moving an existing one), and post a plain-text note recording the checks performed and their outcomes — the clearance is audit trail, not just a green light.
7. On CONFLICT, propose up to two alternative windows that clear all three calendars, but only propose — moving another team's scheduled change is a human conversation, never a silent reschedule.
8. Remind the requester of the client-notice obligation for user-visible windows (pair with maintenance-window-notice in communication for the actual notice).

## Guardrails

- Never silently reschedule anything — conflicts are surfaced to humans with options, and the requester confirms before any schedule write.
- A freeze window always wins over convenience; only the documented exception path (maintenance-freeze-windows) overrides it.
- Check shared-infrastructure dependencies, not just the named system — two changes to "different servers" on the same host or same uplink are a collision.
- Scheduling is not approval: a change on the calendar without its approval recorded gets flagged, not executed.
- Result-cap honesty: if the collision search may have hit a result cap, say the sweep is partial rather than declaring the calendar clear.
