# Maintenance Freeze Windows

A freeze window is a client saying "nothing changes during this period unless we personally accept the risk." This skill keeps those windows recorded where intake can find them, enforces them when changes are proposed, and runs the exception path when something genuinely can't wait.

## When to use

- "Accounting firm clients are frozen through tax season — record it."
- Change intake or calendar clearance hit a possible freeze and needs the authoritative answer.
- "We need to patch during their freeze — what's the exception process?"
- A periodic review of freeze records before a known season (year-end, tax, go-live waves).

## Steps

**Recording a freeze:**

1. Capture the freeze as structured facts: client, start/end dates (explicit dates, not "tax season" — resolve the phrase to dates with the client), what is frozen (all changes vs. specific systems), what is exempt (typically security-critical patches and break-fix — get this stated, not assumed), the client-side authority who can grant exceptions, and who requested the freeze.
2. Store it in the location the desk's calendar checks read from — the client's KB/wiki record (pair with client-wiki-page in documentation) — and confirm it's findable via search_knowledge_base using the client's name. A freeze nobody can find protects nobody.
3. Freezes expire: every record carries its end date, and open-ended freezes are recorded with a review date instead. Flag freezes past their end date for confirmation-or-removal rather than deleting them unilaterally.

**Enforcement at intake / scheduling:**

4. When a proposed change window is checked (from change-request-intake or change-calendar-management), match affected clients against active freeze records. Overlap → the change is blocked from scheduling: post a plain-text note citing the specific freeze (client, dates, scope, source record) and set the change back to the requester.
5. Distinguish frozen from exempt: if the change matches the freeze's stated exemptions (e.g. critical security patch), say so explicitly and route it onward as normal — but cite the exemption clause, don't infer one.

**Exception path:**

6. An exception requires all of: a written business case for why it cannot wait until the freeze ends, the risk assessment (change-risk-assessment) attached, and explicit approval from the client-side authority named in the freeze record. Route the approval via send_approval where available; otherwise document the client's written approval verbatim in a note. Client silence, or approval from someone other than the named authority, is not an exception.
7. Record granted exceptions on both the change ticket and the freeze record's history — a freeze that leaks exceptions every week is really a calendar problem, and the pattern should be visible.

## Guardrails

- The default answer during a freeze is no. The agent never grants exceptions — it assembles the case and routes it to the named human authority.
- Never treat an emergency change as an automatic freeze exception: break-glass work during a freeze still notifies the client's named authority immediately (see emergency-change-handling), because the freeze is their risk posture, not the MSP's.
- Resolve vague freeze phrases ("through the busy season") to explicit dates at recording time — vagueness at recording becomes a dispute at enforcement.
- If freeze records may be incomplete or stale (no review in >6 months), say so when clearing a window rather than asserting "no freeze exists."
- Plain-text notes; freeze citations name the source record so the block is verifiable.
