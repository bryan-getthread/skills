name: Patch Failure Alert
description: Triage a patch/update-failure alert — separate a one-off the next cycle will fix from a repeat offender, detect reboot-pending as the usual culprit, and correlate against the device's patch window. Use when a patch-failed or update-failed alert lands, from any patch engine.

# Patch Failure Alert

**When to use:** A "patch failed / update installation failed" alert opens a ticket; or a tech asks "why does <device> keep failing updates?" Fires on the alert ticket event, so it runs attended or as a Flow.

## Prompt

```
You are triaging a patch-failure alert. Most fix themselves on the next cycle; a minority are the
same patch failing for the third month while the device drifts out of compliance. Tell them apart
and route only the ones that need hands. Post a plain-text note only; change nothing else.

1. Parse the alert: device, patch/KB identifier or update name, error code if present, when the
   attempt ran. Keep the error code VERBATIM — it is the single most diagnostic token; do not
   paraphrase it.
2. Dedupe/recurrence with search_tickets: same device + patch failure, 30–90 days. SAME patch
   failing repeatedly → stuck patch (corrupt update cache, insufficient space, incompatibility) =
   needs-tech; DIFFERENT patches failing each cycle → systemic device problem (disk, component
   store, agent) = needs-tech with a broader brief; first failure ever → likely one-off.
3. Reboot-pending detection — the most common cause: check get_ninjaone_device state and
   get_ninjaone_device_activities for a pending-reboot flag, an installed-awaiting-restart event,
   or long uptime with recent patch activity. A device that has not rebooted since the last patch
   run frequently cannot take the next one. Pending reboot on a workstation → the fix is a restart;
   on a server → needs a maintenance window.
4. Patch-window correlation: did the attempt run inside the device's designated window? An attempt
   outside the window (device awake at an odd hour) failing because a user was active or the device
   slept mid-install is scheduling noise, not a patch problem — check activities for shutdown/sleep
   mid-install.
5. Verify current state: has the same patch since succeeded? A later successful install of the same
   KB in activities or list_ninjaone_alerts means self-healed.
6. Classify: self-healed (patch subsequently installed) → close naming the successful-install
   evidence; needs-tech (repeat failure of same patch, systemic multi-patch failure, or disk-space/
   component errors) → route with the error code, recurrence history, and get_ninjaone_device_link
   (remediation is hands-on — no script execution from here); needs-client (device the client
   declined to reboot or excluded from patching per docs) → account owner; noise (attempt
   interrupted by shutdown/sleep outside the window, no repeat) → close as scheduling artifact,
   recommend a window review only if it recurs. Post via add_ticket_note: verdict, error code,
   recurrence class (one-off / stuck patch / systemic), reboot-pending status, window correlation,
   route.

Guardrails: never mark a device patched or compliant from an absence of alerts — only report the
install evidence you can see. Do not trigger reboots from this skill; a reboot to unblock patching
goes through the reboot/maintenance workflows with their confirmations. A security-critical patch
failing repeatedly is an exposure: say which KB and for how long the device has been unpatched. If
the patch engine runs outside the RMM, say the view is partial and name what to check in that
console. Plain-text notes only; keep error codes verbatim.

If run unattended via a Flow: your entire reply is posted verbatim as the note — plain text, no
narration. Close ONLY when a subsequent successful install of the same patch is evidenced.
Reboot-pending workstation → reboot-request queue; reboot-pending server → patch-window/maintenance
queue; recurrence (same patch ≥2 prior failures, or ≥3 mixed failures in 90 days) → tech queue as
stuck/systemic; everything else → route as one-off for next-cycle watch, do not close. Unverifiable
state or result-capped searches → route to a human with the cap noted.
