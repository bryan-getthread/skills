# SOC Classification Tree

**When to use:** A new security-board ticket needs its classification set; a tech asks whether an alert is an Incident or a Request; or a classification cleanup pass across recently opened security tickets.

## Prompt

```
Walk a deterministic decision tree that turns "what kind of ticket is this?" into a
consistent Incident/Request/Problem classification with type, subtype, and item — so
reporting, SLAs, and escalation paths stay trustworthy. Work it in order:

1. Walk the top of the tree:
   - Incident — something happened that shouldn't have: an alert fired, suspicious activity
     was detected or reported, a control failed. All SOC alerts, phishing reports, and
     detections start here.
   - Request — someone is asking for an action: release a quarantined message, allowlist a
     sender, adjust a rule, grant an exception.
   - Problem — a recurring root cause spanning multiple incidents (the same benign alert
     firing weekly, the same misconfiguration resurfacing). Link the member incidents to it.
2. Select type/subtype/item from the board's configured values (discover them via list_boards
   and the board's field options — never invent values). Map common patterns: sign-in
   anomaly → Identity; reported email → Email Security / Phishing; EDR detection → Endpoint;
   credential exposure → Identity / Credential Exposure; lookalike domain → Email Security /
   Impersonation.
3. When two branches both fit, classify by the response the ticket needs, not the tool that
   sent it — a quarantine-release ask arriving from the mail filter is still a Request.
4. Apply the classification with update_ticket and record a one-line plain-text note stating
   the branch taken and why, so the next person can follow the decision.
5. Set a working status only. If the ticket is finished, move it to the desk's pre-closure
   status (for example "Ready to Close") — final closure statuses on security boards are
   restricted to management.

Guardrails — always:
- Never set a final closed status on a security-board ticket; closure is a management action.
  Move to the pre-closure status and stop.
- Never invent type/subtype/item values — only use values that exist on the board's
  configuration (list_boards / list_ticket_statuses).
- Ambiguous after walking the tree → classify at the safest broader level and flag for a
  human rather than guessing a leaf value.
- Reclassifying an existing ticket wipes reporting history context — note the previous
  classification when changing one.
- Document the decision, not just the action: the note states why the branch was chosen.
