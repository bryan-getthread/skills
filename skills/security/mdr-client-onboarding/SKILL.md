# MDR Client Onboarding

The desk-side checklist for turning on managed detection for a client: what's covered (and what visibly isn't), where the alerts land and who works them, who may authorize containment at 3 a.m., and why the first month will be noisy — set on the record before the first alert fires.

## When to use

- A client signed for MDR/SOC monitoring and the service is being stood up
- Alerts from a newly-enabled monitoring service start arriving and routing/expectations were never documented
- A service review asks "what exactly does the MDR cover for this client?"

## Steps

1. Asset scoping — coverage in writing: enumerate what the sensor/agent will cover using the RMM inventory (search_ninjaone_devices / connectwise_rmm_search_devices) and documentation (search_itglue): endpoints, servers, identity tenant, mail, network devices. Produce the coverage list AND the exclusions list (unsupported OS versions, unmanaged/BYOD devices, that one appliance) — the uncovered list is the more important document, because everyone will later assume "the MDR watches everything." Record both with an as-of date.
2. Deployment verification: reconcile deployed-agent count against the in-scope asset count; gap list becomes deployment tickets (create_ticket). "Purchased" is not "protected" — the onboarding isn't done until the reconciliation says so, with result-cap honesty on any counts.
3. Alert routing into the desk: agree and document where MDR alerts land (which board/queue), what identifiers the alert body carries for client attribution (tenant ID, domain — feed this to the security-alert-response routing step), the severity mapping between the provider's labels and the desk's tiers, and the after-hours path. Test the route with the provider's test alert before go-live; a routing test that lands nowhere is the cheapest incident you'll ever prevent.
4. Escalation contacts and authority — recorded in the client's documentation:
   - Client side: who the provider/desk may call at any hour, in what order, with verified phone numbers on file.
   - Authority matrix: what the MDR provider may do autonomously (e.g. isolate a host) versus what needs client approval versus desk-executed actions. The pre-authorization decisions made here are what make the compromised-account-containment and ransomware-response paths fast later — get them signed, not implied.
5. Baseline-noise period expectations, set with the client in advance: the first two to four weeks produce elevated alert volume while the provider learns the environment (legitimate admin tools, backup jobs, scanners all look suspicious to a fresh sensor). Every alert still gets verified — baseline period is context for volume, never a reason to close unread. Recurring confirmed-benign patterns get fed back to the provider for tuning (security-noise-tuning discipline: narrow suppressions, at the source, never PSA auto-close).
6. Go-live record: coverage + exclusions, routing test result, severity mapping, authority matrix, baseline expectations, and a 30-day review ticket (create_ticket) to reassess noise levels, coverage gaps, and whether escalations worked as designed. Note the monthly-security-report skill as the ongoing reporting vehicle.

## Guardrails

- The exclusions list is mandatory output — never let "MDR onboarded" imply total coverage; state what is not watched.
- No alert is closed unverified because "it's the baseline period"; the period predicts volume, not verdicts.
- Containment authority must be written and client-signed before go-live — never assume the provider or desk may isolate hosts or disable accounts without the documented authorization.
- Escalation phone numbers are verified at onboarding, not first used during an incident.
- Provider-severity labels map to desk tiers explicitly; don't inherit a foreign severity scale silently.
- Degradation: without RMM connectors, the deployment reconciliation runs on provider + client-supplied exports — record their as-of dates and gaps rather than presenting them as live truth.
