# Phishing Simulation Program

**When to use:** A client asks to start (or restart) phishing simulations, often driven by insurance or compliance; a campaign is being planned and the desk needs scope, schedule, and coordination tickets; or simulation results are in and the client wants the readout and next-cycle plan.

**Run it:** across a client's user population (a simulation program, planned and coordinated).

## Prompt

```
Turn "we should run phishing tests" into a coordinated program: who gets simulated and how
often, how difficulty ramps, how results are reported without shaming anyone, and —
critically — how the desk's phishing-triage keeps treating real phish as real while the
campaign runs. You plan and coordinate; the simulation platform is operated by the
technician or the client's program owner. Work it in order:

1. Scope the program with the client's stakeholder: which user groups (all staff; ramping
   by department is fine, exempting executives is not — leadership is the most-targeted
   group in real attacks), cadence (monthly or quarterly is typical; more frequent breeds
   alarm fatigue), and difficulty progression (start obvious, ramp toward role-relevant).
   Record the agreed scope in a plain-text note.
2. Culture rule, set before the first send: the program measures the organization's
   resilience, not individuals' failures. Reported-rate is the headline metric;
   named-individual click lists go ONLY to the client's designated program owner, never
   into general reporting. Clicking earns a short training moment, not a reprimand.
3. Simulation-detection interplay — the coordination step that protects the desk: document
   the simulation platform's sending domains and link domains in the client's knowledge
   record (check the knowledge base for what's recorded; flag gaps for the tech to fill).
   The phishing-triage skill's simulation branch matches against exactly this record — if
   it isn't documented, every simulation email becomes a real investigation and every reply
   skews the client's metrics.
4. Whitelisting and delivery checks: the simulation domains need mail-gateway/filter
   allowances so results measure users, not the spam filter. Open a coordination ticket for
   the gateway work, and schedule the campaign window so the desk knows when
   simulation-driven report volume is expected.
5. During the campaign: user reports of simulation emails are GOOD outcomes — phishing-
   triage closes them internally without replying (a reply skews metrics). Real phishing
   does not pause for campaigns: anything not matching the documented simulator domains gets
   the full real-phish treatment. Never assume "it's probably the simulation."
6. Readout: report cohort-level metrics — report rate, click rate, credential-entry rate,
   trend versus prior cycles — with result-cap honesty on any ticket-derived counts.
   Recommend the next cycle's difficulty and any targeted training for high-risk patterns
   (not named individuals in general reporting). Output is the plan or readout as
   chat/note.

Guardrails — always:
- No-shame is non-negotiable: named-individual results go only to the designated program
  owner; general reporting stays cohort-level. Never publish "wall of shame" lists.
- Never let a live campaign lower the desk's guard: only an EXACT match against documented
  simulator domains closes a report as simulation — partial matches get investigated as
  real.
- Do not send or schedule simulation emails yourself; this skill plans and coordinates —
  the platform owner executes sends.
- Lure content stays professional: no fake HR terminations, bonus revocations, or
  health-scare lures — realistic is the goal, cruel is a program-killer.
- Simulation domains and scope belong in the client's documentation before the first send;
  refuse to mark a campaign "ready" without that record.
- Degradation: without knowledge-base access, confirm the simulator-domain record with the
  tech directly and note where it lives. Never invent metrics.
