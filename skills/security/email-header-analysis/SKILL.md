# Email Header Analysis

The deep-parse companion to phishing-triage: take pasted raw headers and produce a structured, evidence-cited verdict — what the authentication says, where the message actually came from, and how confident the conclusion is.

## When to use

- "Analyze this header" / "is this email legit?" with raw headers pasted
- Phishing-triage needs the header-level detail behind a verdict
- A DMARC/SPF ticket needs the per-message evidence read

## Steps

1. Parse the authentication block first: Authentication-Results for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC outcomes AND the domains they evaluated — a pass for a domain other than the visible From domain (alignment failure) is the classic spoof shape.
2. Walk the Received chain bottom-up: the originating IP and host, each hop, and anomalies — an "internal-looking" first hop arriving from external IP space, missing hops, or timestamps that run backwards.
3. Compare the identity fields: From vs Return-Path vs Reply-To. A Reply-To diverging to an unrelated domain is a high-weight lure indicator. Check the Message-ID domain against the claimed sender, and note filter-added X-headers (spam scores, gateway verdicts) as corroborating signals.
4. Contextual checks, passive only: web_search for the sending domain's registration recency (never visit links from the message), and search_tickets for prior reports of the same sender at the client.
5. Weigh the picture — including the trap cases: full authentication pass with lure content can be a compromised legitimate account (auth pass ≠ safe); authentication fail on a forwarded message can be innocent (forwarding breaks SPF). Say which case applies.
6. Output a structured verdict block, plain text: VERDICT (spoofed / likely legitimate / compromised-sender suspected / inconclusive), CONFIDENCE (high / medium / low) with one line on why, KEY EVIDENCE (the specific header lines, quoted), and RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP (phishing-triage containment, quarantine-release path, dmarc-spf-failure-triage, or no action). Post as a note when working a ticket.

## Guardrails

- Never state a verdict without a confidence level and the header lines that support it.
- Headers below the first trusted hop can be forged — say explicitly which parts of the chain are trustworthy and which are claimed.
- Authentication pass does not mean safe; authentication fail does not always mean attack. The verdict must address content and context, not scores alone.
- Never fetch URLs or resources referenced in the message during analysis.
- Inconclusive is an acceptable verdict — when in doubt, escalate to phishing-triage handling rather than forcing a call. A false escalation is cheap, a missed compromise isn't.

## Unattended (Flows) variant

- Follows the Unattended Output Discipline contract: the entire reply is the plain-text verdict block (VERDICT / CONFIDENCE / KEY EVIDENCE / RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP) posted verbatim as an internal note. No narration, no markdown.
- Deterministic inputs from the flow: the ticket whose thread contains the raw headers. Headers absent or unparseable → output nothing — a verdict without headers is fabrication.
- Inconclusive is a valid unattended verdict: post it with CONFIDENCE low and RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP "escalate to phishing-triage handling"; never force spoofed/legitimate to avoid it.
- Permitted writes: `add_ticket_note` only. No status, priority, or assignment changes; containment actions stay attended.
- Never fetch URLs or resources from the analyzed message, in any mode; `web_search` stays passive (registration facts only).
