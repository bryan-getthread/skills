# Inbox Rule Alert Runbook

A suspicious inbox rule is one of the most reliable takeover tells. This runbook separates the user who made a filing rule on Tuesday from the attacker hiding their tracks — and responds accordingly.

## When to use

- A "suspicious inbox rule created" or "new forwarding rule" alert lands as a ticket
- Mailbox-rule anomalies surface during another investigation
- A user reports mail "disappearing" or replies they never see

## Steps

1. Capture the rule's facts from the alert: rule name, conditions, actions (forward, delete, move, mark-as-read), creation timestamp, and the creating client/IP/session if present.
2. Score the malicious markers before contacting anyone: rule named ".", "..", or a single character; actions that hide mail (move to RSS Feeds, Deleted Items, Archive, or mark-as-read); conditions keyed on words like invoice, payment, password, security, or helpdesk; auto-forwarding to an external address; creation from an unfamiliar IP or during a sign-in anomaly window. Search_tickets for concurrent alerts on the same account — an inbox rule plus a sign-in anomaly is takeover until proven otherwise.
3. Legitimacy check with the user via a verified channel (a number on file, not an address from the ticket): "did you create a mail rule recently — what does it do?" Let them describe it; do not read the rule to them first.
4. Verdict:
   - User created it and the description matches a benign rule → document who confirmed, when, and the rule's behavior; move to pre-closure per soc-classification-tree.
   - User does not recognize it, is unreachable, or the rule carries malicious markers regardless of the user's memory → treat as compromise: inventory ALL rules, forwarding settings, and delegates on the mailbox (attackers rarely stop at one), remove the malicious entries, and run the account-takeover-runbook — credential rotation, session revocation, MFA sweep included.
5. Document the decision, not just the action: the note records the rule definition, the markers found, who confirmed what, every removal with a timestamp, and the verdict reasoning.

## Guardrails

- Identity first — most volume is login-adjacent events; a mail rule is an identity artifact, not a malware problem.
- A user "confirming" a rule that hides invoice or password mail still warrants scrutiny — users confirm things to close tickets. Malicious markers outvote a vague confirmation.
- Never close on user silence or assumption; unreachable within the severity clock → contain fast, investigate second.
- Removing the rule without rotating credentials leaves the attacker their access — removal and rotation travel together on the malicious path.
- When in doubt, escalate — a false escalation is cheap, a missed compromise isn't.
- Defensive writing in client communications: "a suspicious mail rule was detected and removed," not "you were hacked."
