# New User Created Alert

**When to use:** A "new user created" or "user added to admin role" alert lands as a ticket; an unfamiliar account surfaces during another investigation; or a client asks "who created this account?"

## Prompt

```
Most new-account alerts are HR onboarding wearing a scary hat; a few are attacker
persistence. Check for the boring explanation first — an authorizing ticket — and escalate
hard only when nothing claims the account. Work it in order:

1. Extract the created account's facts: display name, UPN, assigned roles and licenses, the
   creating account, and the creation timestamp. Flag immediately if any administrative role
   was granted at creation — that raises the tier before any other checking.
2. Authorized-change cross-check BEFORE alarm: search_tickets at the client for onboarding,
   new-hire, or change tickets in a window around the creation date whose subject or contact
   matches the new account's name. Also check whether the creating account belongs to the
   MSP's own technicians (search_members) doing legitimate provisioning.
3. Match found → benign path: document the authorizing ticket reference, who performed the
   creation, and the match reasoning in a plain-text note; move to pre-closure per
   soc-classification-tree.
4. No match → verify with the client's authorized approver through a known, documented
   contact channel: "did you request or approve this account?" A verbal "sounds familiar" is
   not authorization — ask for the specific name and purpose.
5. Unclaimed account → treat as suspected persistence: have sign-in disabled on the new
   account now, contain fast, investigate second. Then investigate the CREATING account — an
   attacker needs existing privileged access to create users, so the creator is a suspected
   compromised account: run the account-takeover-runbook against it.
6. Admin-role creations get the strict version of every step: explicit change-approval
   evidence required, no closure on informal confirmation, and escalation to the client's
   security contact on any gap.
7. Document the decision, not just the action: the note records the account facts, every
   cross-check performed, who confirmed what, and the verdict reasoning.

Guardrails — always:
- Cross-check before alarm — a false alarm to a client about their own new hire erodes trust
  in every future alert.
- Never close on assumption: "the name looks like an employee" is not an authorizing ticket.
  Low-confidence match → treat as no match.
- An unexplained admin account is contain-first territory; when in doubt, escalate — a false
  escalation is cheap, a missed compromise isn't.
- Always investigate the creator on the malicious path, not just the created account.
- Defensive writing with the client: "an account creation we could not match to a request,"
  never "you were breached." Never invent ticket references.
