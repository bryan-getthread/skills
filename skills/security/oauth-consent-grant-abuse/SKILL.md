# OAuth Consent Grant Abuse

**When to use:** An alert fires for a newly consented enterprise app, a risky OAuth grant, or an unfamiliar app with mail/file permissions; a user reports approving an app "to view a document" that then behaved oddly; or persistence hunting during a takeover/BEC recovery surfaces an attacker-added app consent.

**Run it:** on one ticket (a suspicious OAuth grant).

## Prompt

```
Consent phishing skips the password entirely: the user is tricked into granting a rogue app
OAuth permissions (read mail, send mail, read files), and the app now holds durable access
via a refresh token — no password to reset, MFA never challenged again. Find the grant,
revoke it, and close the consent path. You drive and document; the client's admin executes
tenant changes. Work it in order:

1. Identify the grant: which app, which account(s) consented, what permissions (delegated
   vs. application/tenant-wide), and when. Application-level and admin-consented grants are
   the most dangerous — they can persist beyond any single user.
2. Judge legitimacy before revoking blindly: is this a known business app the client
   actually uses, or an unfamiliar/lookalike app requesting broad mail/file scopes? Broad
   "read/send mail" or "read all files" scopes on an unknown app is malicious until proven
   otherwise. Check publisher verification and consent timestamp against any sign-in
   anomaly.
3. Revoke on the malicious verdict: direct the client's admin to remove the app's
   grant/service-principal and revoke its issued tokens tenant-side — this kills the refresh
   token that gives the app standing access. Password resets do NOT touch an OAuth grant;
   the app keeps access until the grant itself is revoked.
4. Assess what the app could reach during its access window: mailbox contents, files,
   directory data. If mail was accessible and fraud may have flowed, branch to
   business-email-compromise-recovery. Preserve the grant definition and app audit logs
   before removal.
5. Close the vector tenant-wide: recommend the client restrict user consent (require admin
   approval for third-party apps, or limit consent to verified publishers and low-risk
   scopes) and enable an admin-consent request workflow. Flag it as the priority
   remediation, owned by the client's admin.
6. Check for co-planted persistence (inbox rules, forwarding, delegates) if the grant
   accompanied a takeover.
7. Document the decision, not just the action: the app, its scopes, the legitimacy
   reasoning, what was revoked and when, the access-window assessment, and the consent-policy
   recommendation with its owner. Classify per soc-classification-tree.

Guardrails — always:
- An OAuth grant is separate persistence — a password reset and session revocation do NOT
  remove it. Revoke the grant explicitly or the app stays in.
- Revoking grants and changing tenant consent policy are admin actions owned by the client —
  recommend and drive; never modify tenant app registrations or consent settings yourself.
- Don't revoke a legitimate business app on reflex — verify the app and scopes first; a
  wrongful revoke can break a real integration. But broad scopes on an unknown/unverified
  publisher outvote convenience.
- Tenant-wide (admin-consented / application) grants outrank single-user grants in urgency —
  they survive individual account cleanup.
- Defensive writing: "an unauthorized application grant was detected and removed," not "your
  tenant was breached"; do not assert data exfiltration without log evidence. Plain text
  only. When in doubt, escalate and restrict consent.
