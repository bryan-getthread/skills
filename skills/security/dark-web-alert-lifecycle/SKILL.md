# Dark Web Alert Lifecycle

**When to use:** A dark-web monitoring alert lands as a ticket (exposed email, password, hash, or PII); a batch of credential-exposure alerts needs working; or a Flow auto-processes the dark-web alert board.

## Prompt

```
Dark-web feeds resurface the same decade-old leaks endlessly. Separate stale re-reports
(close with a note) from fresh exposures (notify, rotate, verify MFA) — with a hard policy
line on what never happens to the leaked data itself. Work it in order:

1. Parse the alert: affected identity/email, breach source if named, the breach or
   first-seen date, and the exposed data classes (plaintext password, hash, PII,
   email-only).
2. Age check: if the exposure's breach/first-seen date is more than 90 days old, close
   with a plain-text note recording the source, the date, the data classes, and the
   rationale ("stale exposure, outside the actionable window"). Use search_tickets for a
   prior ticket on the same identity + source and reference it if found.
3. If the date is missing or unparseable, do NOT apply the stale path — treat it as fresh
   or leave it for a human.
4. Fresh path (90 days or newer): identify the affected user via search_contacts, confirm
   they are a current employee, and notify them (view_openDraft, human sends) with
   rotation guidance: change the exposed password on the affected service AND everywhere it
   was reused, prefer a password manager and unique passwords, verify MFA is enabled with
   methods the user recognizes. Branch to breached-credential-response for a
   confirmed-current credential, and to compromised-account-containment if there is any
   sign the credential was already used.
5. Document the decision, not just the action: verdict, age math, data classes, and what
   was sent to whom. Classify per soc-classification-tree; closure statuses stay with
   management.

Unattended (Flows) variant:
- Your entire reply is posted verbatim as the internal ticket note — no narration, no
  questions, plain text only.
- Only two autonomous outcomes exist: (a) stale path — date parsed, older than 90 days →
  write the closure note and set the pre-closure status; (b) fresh path — write a triage
  note stating the exposure facts and that user notification is required, leave the ticket
  open for a human. Never send client email autonomously.
- Missing/ambiguous date, unrecognized identity, or any parsing doubt → do nothing: leave
  the ticket untouched for a human.

Guardrails — always:
- POLICY: never attempt to crack, decode, or look up leaked passwords or hashes on external
  sites or tools — no hash-lookup services, no paste sites, no "checking if it still
  works." Treat any exposed hash as a compromised password and rotate. Submitting client
  data to third-party sites is itself a data exposure.
- Never attempt to sign in with a leaked credential to "verify" it.
- Never include the exposed password or hash value in any client-facing message; identify
  the exposure by service and date.
- Stale-path closure requires a parseable date — no date, no auto-close.
- Departed-employee exposure → route to the client contact rather than the individual, and
  flag any still-active accounts.
- Defensive writing: this is a "credential exposure notification," not a breach of the
  client's systems — say so explicitly. Never invent data.
