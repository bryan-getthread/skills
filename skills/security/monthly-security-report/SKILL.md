# Monthly Security Report

One client, one month, one digest: what fired, what mattered, whether posture is trending the right way, and what to do next — with counts the desk can defend.

## When to use

- "Build <client>'s monthly security report"
- A vCIO/CSM needs the security section for a monthly or quarterly review
- A recurring per-client security digest cadence

## Steps

1. Fix the reporting window (the calendar month unless told otherwise) and pull the client's security tickets with search_tickets, split per type per board — phishing reports, sign-in/identity alerts, EDR detections, credential exposures, vendor-fraud reports, requests (quarantine releases, allowlists). If any search hits its result cap, report that figure as "at least N" — never present a capped count as exact.
2. Count and compare: this month's counts by type against the prior month's. Note the biggest movers and — where the tickets say so — why (a phishing campaign, a new alert source onboarded, tuning that landed).
3. Notable events: the month's P1/P2 security incidents, each as one line — what happened, how fast it was contained, outcome. Facts from the tickets with timestamps; defensive-writing-standard wording.
4. Posture trend: pull liongard_cyber_risk_dashboard deltas where available (score movement, MFA coverage change, open detections). Liongard absent → the trend section is ticket-derived only and labeled as such.
5. Recommendations: two or three, each tied explicitly to this month's data ("phishing reports doubled → schedule awareness refresh"; "the same benign alert consumed N tickets → tuning recommendation attached" via security-noise-tuning). Recommendations, never actions reported as done.
6. Produce the right edition: the internal edition may reference tooling detail and open investigations; the client edition strips other-client references, individual staff names, and anything under active investigation that management hasn't cleared for disclosure. Post as a plain-text note or deliver as draft text for the CSM.

## Guardrails

- Result-cap honesty is the headline rule — a security report with silently truncated counts is worse than no report.
- Client edition never names individual employees in a negative light ("3 users clicked" not "<user> clicked"), never references other clients, and follows the defensive-writing-standard.
- Never disclose an open investigation's specifics in the client edition without management sign-off.
- Counts and events come from tickets — no estimated or recalled figures; if a data source was unavailable for part of the month, say so.
- Trend claims require both months measured the same way; if the search method changed, note the break in comparability.
