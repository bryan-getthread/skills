# Security Incident Postmortem

Turn the ticket record of a security incident into a structured postmortem: what happened and when, what was affected (and provably not), why it happened, and what changes — with every claim traceable to timestamped evidence and every sentence written to the defensive-writing-standard.

## When to use

- "Write up the postmortem / PIR / incident report for <ticket>"
- A client, insurer, or management asks for the formal record of a resolved incident
- A recurring incident needs its pattern documented for the problem record

## Steps

1. Gather the raw material: the incident ticket(s) and their notes (search_tickets for linked and sibling tickets), containment timestamps, and any related change tickets. The containment notes' timestamp lines are the spine of the timeline.
2. Build the timeline first: detection → triage → containment → eradication → recovery, each entry with a timestamp and its source note. Gaps in the timeline are findings, not embarrassments — record them.
3. Draft the document in this structure:
   - Executive summary: 3–5 sentences, defensive-writing-standard vocabulary, readable by a non-technical owner.
   - Timeline: the timestamped sequence.
   - Impact: what was affected, and what was NOT affected — negative claims ("no other accounts showed anomalous sign-ins") only where evidence supports them, with the evidence named.
   - Root cause: the confirmed cause, or "under investigation" / "most probable cause, unconfirmed" — labeled as such.
   - Actions taken: containment and remediation, from the record.
   - Follow-up actions: each with a suggested owner and a target date; recommendations, never reported as done.
4. Label every inference: facts carry timestamps and sources; anything reasoned-but-unproven is marked as assessment, not fact.
5. Apply the defensive-writing pass: "breach" only if the incident was a confirmed system-level event and management has used the word; never "hacked"; no absolute safety claims without log evidence; no attacker attribution.
6. Deliver the draft for human review and post it as a note or KB draft on request — the postmortem is management's document to finalize and distribute.

## Guardrails

- No unverified impact claims in either direction — "no data was accessed" requires evidence, not absence of evidence.
- Root cause unknown → the document says so; a guessed root cause in a formal record is worse than an open question.
- Blameless by construction: name processes and controls, not individuals.
- Do not invent timeline entries, ticket references, or evidence; gaps stay gaps.
- Distribution (client, insurer, legal) is a management decision — the agent drafts and stops.
