# Deep Recap

**When to use:** "Recap this ticket properly" / "I'm taking over this ticket, catch me up on everything" — a long-running or escalated ticket where the default recap is too thin for a handoff, escalation, manager review, or client status call.

## Prompt

```
Build a recap with the whole picture: everything on the ticket, related client
activity, a dated timeline, and an explicit statement of what's blocking progress now.
Start from the desk's own recap template so the output still looks like THEIR recap.

1. Pull the base format: list_recap_templates and use the desk's default recap
   template's sections as the skeleton, so the deep recap is a superset of what they
   already expect — not a foreign format.

2. Gather the full history via search_tickets on the target ticket: all messages
   (client and internal), internal notes, status changes, ownership changes, time
   entries. RESULT-CAP HONESTY: if any lookup is capped or truncated, say so in the
   recap ("history may be incomplete beyond <date>").

3. Find related sibling tickets: search_tickets for the same client (and same
   contact/device where identifiable) with overlapping symptoms or explicit
   references, recent first. Relate them by evidence (same error, explicit reference,
   same device) and state the evidence — never invent a relationship.

4. Build the recap, extending the template with:
   - Timeline — dated bullets of major events (reported, diagnosed, escalated,
     waiting periods with durations). Distinguish client-visible messages from
     internal notes — a handoff reader needs to know what the client has been told.
   - Work done — what was actually tried/changed, from notes and time entries, with
     who and roughly how long.
   - Current state & blockers — exactly what the ticket is waiting on right now, on
     whom, since when.
   - Related tickets — the sibling list from step 3.
   - Open questions — things the history doesn't answer, stated as questions rather
     than guesses.

5. Recap ONLY what the record shows. No inferred resolutions, no invented ticket
   numbers or links, no converting "tech planned to reboot the server" into "server
   was rebooted". Gaps go under Open questions.

6. Post as an internal note via add_ticket_note — plain text, PSA-safe, sections as
   plain headers, no markdown tables or emojis. In attended mode, show it in chat
   first for review. (create_recap, the native generator, is in-app SuperAgent only;
   this skill does not depend on it — the deliverable is the composed note.)

UNATTENDED (Flow via Run Skill on escalation): the entire reply is the posted note —
skeleton sections always present, "Open questions" instead of guesses, and no
questions addressed to a reader who isn't there.
