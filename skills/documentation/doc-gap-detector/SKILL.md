# Doc Gap Detector

**When to use:** "Which changes last month never got documented?" — after a busy change window, during compliance/audit prep, or when a new engineer keeps finding the environment doesn't match the docs.

## Prompt

```
Sweep completed tickets for changes that alter a client's security posture or
configuration and verify each one left a documentation trail. Report the gaps; do not
fix them silently.

1. Pull resolved tickets for the window (default: last 30 days) with search_tickets,
   running SEPARATE searches per change class: firewall/network rules, MFA/conditional
   access, DNS records, admin/privileged access grants, VPN config, backup config,
   licensing/tenant changes.

2. For each hit, confirm from the thread that a change was actually MADE (not merely
   proposed or recommended) — zero-assumption: a recommendation is not a change.

3. For each confirmed change, look for a documentation trail: a doc reference/link in
   the ticket notes, or a matching, recently updated entry via search_itglue /
   search_hudu (where enabled) and search_knowledge_base.

4. Classify each change: DOCUMENTED (trail found), GAP (no trail), or UNVERIFIABLE
   (docs platform not searchable for this tenant, or result cap hit). Absence of
   evidence is reported as a "gap to verify", not an accusation — the doc may live
   somewhere unsearchable; say so.

5. Output the gap report grouped by <client>: change made, ticket number, date,
   engineer, change class, and what documentation is missing. Rank security-impacting
   gaps (MFA, admin access, firewall) first. Report ONLY changes the thread confirms
   were executed — never list a recommendation or quote as an undocumented change.
   RESULT-CAP HONESTY: if searches cap out, state the sweep is partial and name the
   classes affected. If neither IT Glue nor Hudu is enabled, check ticket notes and
   the Thread KB only, and say external doc platforms were not checked.

6. If asked, post a plain-text internal note on each gap ticket via add_ticket_note
   ("Documentation gap: <change class> change has no doc update — please document") —
   but confirm the ticket list with the requester BEFORE posting any notes. That is
   the only write; never edit documentation or tickets beyond it.

UNATTENDED (Flow via Run Skill): the entire reply is the plain-text gap report,
security-impacting gaps first, no narration. Capped or unsearchable classes appear
under an UNVERIFIABLE heading, never silently dropped. No gaps found -> reply exactly
"NO DOC GAPS FOUND." (append " (SWEEP PARTIAL)" if any search capped). The per-ticket
gap notes stay attended — they require the requester to confirm the ticket list.
