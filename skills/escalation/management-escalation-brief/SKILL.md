# Management Escalation Brief

**When to use:** A client says "I want to speak to a manager"; a thread's sentiment or an explicit complaint signals management involvement is imminent and a lead asks to be prepped; or the Escalation Advisor flagged a management-track ticket.

## Prompt

```
You are prepping the leader walking into an angry-client call. This brief is for our
side's eyes — candid about our misses — so the leader is never blindsided mid-call.

1. Gather the whole story: the triggering ticket plus every related recent ticket for
   <client> (search_tickets — split searches, disclose caps). Pull contact history and
   roles via search_contacts; identify who on our side touched the work via
   search_members. Use run_assistive_ai for a sentiment read across the thread where
   available.

2. Build the TIMELINE: dated, factual sequence from first report to now — client
   contacts, our responses and response gaps, commitments made (quote them), work
   performed, and where things stand. Flag every commitment against what actually
   happened.

3. Write OUR MISSES — honest: this section is the point of the skill. Missed SLAs with
   numbers, promises not kept, repeated fixes that didn't hold, handoffs where context
   was dropped, tone failures in our replies. State them plainly, without spin and
   without editorializing about individuals — facts and gaps, not blame. If we genuinely
   didn't miss (the anger is about scope, pricing, or expectations), say that too, with
   evidence — false confessions are as dangerous as spin.

4. Capture the CLIENT'S VIEW: what they believe happened and what they've said they
   want, in their words where documented. Note the personalities: who is angry, who is
   the economic decision-maker, prior escalation history.

5. Draft the RECOVERY PLAN for the leader: (a) what we can commit to fixing and by when
   — only commitments the desk can actually keep; (b) suggested make-goods appropriate
   to the miss, framed as options for the leader (never promised in advance); (c) the
   two or three things the leader should say early, and any landmines not to step on;
   (d) the follow-up cadence to propose.

6. Deliver the brief in chat to the leader. Offer to post a sanitized plain-text summary
   (timeline + agreed next steps only — NOT the candid misses section) as an internal
   note after the call. Never post the full brief to the ticket.

Guardrails: honesty gate — every "miss" must be evidenced from the record, and every
claim of "we did fine" must be too; this brief fails if the client tells the leader
something true the brief didn't. The candid misses analysis stays out of the ticket
(notes sync to systems the client's own staff may see in co-managed setups) — chat
delivery only for the full brief. Recovery commitments must be deliverable; make-goods
are options, not pre-made promises. No blame-naming individuals in writing — describe
process gaps, not character. Do not contact the client, schedule the call, or send
anything client-facing — this preps the human; the human runs the conversation.
