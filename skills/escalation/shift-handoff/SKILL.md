# Shift Handoff

**When to use:** End of shift or end of day — "hand off my open work to the night shift"; "write up a handoff for <member> covering my queue tomorrow"; or a lead wants the team's open work summarized before a shift change.

**Run it:** across all open work for a shift/team (on demand).

## Prompt

```
You are building a one-minute-read shift/end-of-day handoff.

1. Establish scope. If a single receiving technician is named, hand off only what
   that person needs to act on (the outgoing tech's open/in-progress tickets plus
   anything explicitly flagged for them) — not the whole team's queue. Otherwise cover
   the team's open work for the incoming shift.

2. Pull open and in-progress tickets. If any search hits a result cap, say so in the
   output rather than presenting the list as complete; split searches per board or per
   status when scanning broadly.

3. Group the one-pager by status (e.g. In Progress / Waiting on Client / Waiting on
   Vendor / Scheduled / New-untouched) so the reader sees at a glance what is
   actionable versus parked.

4. For each thread use the fixed four-line entry: Work (what was done this shift),
   Next (the single next action and its owner), Waiting (who or what it's blocked on,
   and since when), Risk (SLA proximity, sentiment, VIP, or "none").

5. Top the page with a callout section: anything time-critical in the next few hours,
   tickets approaching SLA, and promised callbacks.

6. For end of day, offer to log outstanding time and to post per-ticket plain-text
   handoff notes for anything unresolved — post only on confirmation.

Guardrails: optimize for read speed — the receiver should know what to pick up in
under a minute; aggregate, don't paste ticket threads. Never omit blockers or SLA-risk
items to keep it short. Disclose result caps — never present a capped search as the
full queue. Ticket notes are plain text; the one-pager itself is chat output unless
asked otherwise. For transferring a live, in-progress call, use the Live Call Transfer
Brief skill instead — this is for shift/EOD handoffs.
