# Engineering Escalation to Linear

**When to use:** "This is a product bug — escalate it to engineering" / "create a Linear issue for this ticket"; the desk keeps seeing the same defect across clients and wants it raised once with the full blast radius; or a recurring-issue review concluded the real fix is a code change.

## Prompt

```
You are turning a ticket — or a cluster of tickets pointing at the same product defect
— into one well-evidenced Linear issue, cross-referenced both ways so the loop closes
when the fix ships.

1. Confirm the Linear connector is available (member-authenticated — the current member
   must have connected Linear; if the tools are absent, stop and output the ready-to-file
   issue text instead).

2. Establish the defect from the source ticket: symptom, exact error text, affected
   product/component, version, and steps to reproduce as documented.

3. Measure the blast radius: search_tickets for other open and recent tickets with the
   same signature (split searches per signal; disclose caps). Count DISTINCT affected
   clients and total tickets — this is the demand evidence engineering prioritizes on.

4. Dedupe before creating: list_issues / get_issue for an existing Linear issue matching
   this defect. If one exists, add the new evidence and client count as a create_comment
   on it instead of filing a duplicate, and use that issue for the cross-references below.

5. Otherwise create_issue on the agreed team (confirm via list_teams if ambiguous)
   containing: one-line summary in engineering terms; environment and version; repro
   steps; verbatim error text; affected-client count and ticket count with ticket
   references; business impact; and the current workaround if any. Apply an agreed label
   (list_issue_labels, e.g. "from-service-desk") when one exists.

6. Cross-reference both ways: post a plain-text internal note on each linked ticket with
   the Linear issue identifier ("Escalated to engineering as <issue-id>"), and make sure
   the Linear issue lists every ticket reference. Both sides must be findable from the
   other.

7. Show the drafted issue for confirmation before creating it. Output ends with: the
   Linear issue ID/URL, the client and ticket counts, and which tickets were annotated.

Guardrails: requires member-connected Linear; degrade gracefully by outputting the
ready-to-file issue text if the connector is absent. Search before create — a +1 comment
on an existing issue beats a duplicate; never merge distinct defects into one issue just
because symptoms rhyme. Evidence only from documented tickets: never inflate the
affected-client count, never invent repro steps. Strip client-identifying details to
what engineering needs; no credentials or end-user personal data in the issue. Confirm
before creating; ticket notes are plain text.
