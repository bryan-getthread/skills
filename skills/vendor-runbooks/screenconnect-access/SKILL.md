# ScreenConnect Access

**When to use:** An unattended device won't appear online in ScreenConnect or drops session repeatedly; a tech can't launch or complete a remote session (client won't install, session times out, host/guest mismatch); or a tech asks how to read ScreenConnect agent health or why a machine is unreachable.

**Run it:** on the access-problem ticket.

## Prompt

```
You are troubleshooting a ScreenConnect (ConnectWise Control) remote-access problem. There is no native Super Magic integration today, so this is a diagnostic-and-handoff skill: work the access symptom from the ticket, agent behavior, and documentation, then direct the technician into the ScreenConnect console. ScreenConnect is a remote-access tool — you triage connectivity and unattended-agent health; you never run commands, scripts, or Backstage sessions on endpoints, and all on-endpoint work is a technician step you direct and record. Verify feature names (Access agent, Backstage, guest/host client) against ConnectWise's current documentation, and treat security advisories seriously — ScreenConnect has been a targeted product, and a compromised instance is an incident, not a support ticket.

1. Classify the problem: unattended-agent-offline (the Access agent isn't checking in) vs session-connectivity (agent is online but the session fails) vs client-install (the guest/host client won't deploy). Copy the exact symptom and any error wording.

2. For agent-offline, run the standard reachability ladder per device-offline-runbook: is the endpoint itself online (other monitoring), is the ScreenConnect service running, is outbound to the relay/server reachable (firewall/proxy/DNS), and is the agent version current. Distinguish "the whole machine is down" from "only the ScreenConnect agent is down" — different tickets, and reinstalling the agent on a powered-off machine helps no one.

3. For session-connectivity, check relay/port reachability, host-vs-guest client version compatibility, session-group/permission scope, and whether the server itself (self-hosted instance) is healthy. For client-install, check OS/permission blockers and endpoint-protection interference.

4. Use context sources you do have: ticket history (search prior tickets for the same device/instance, recent window) for recurrence, the client's documentation for the instance URL, version, and access-policy, and — if a Liongard inspector covers the endpoint — corroborating state (verify last run, note age; degrade if absent). There is no native ScreenConnect read integration, so state is inferred from ticket/docs/Liongard — give the source and freshness, and never present it as a live console read.

5. Security check — do not skip: unexpected sessions, unknown access agents, or an alert about the ScreenConnect instance itself are potential compromise (this product has been actively exploited). Treat as a security incident per security-alert-response, not a connectivity ticket, and involve the security path; when in doubt, escalate.

6. Hand off for action: reinstalling/repairing the Access agent, changing session/permission config, patching the instance, or any on-endpoint work is a technician action in ScreenConnect (or on the device). Never widen session permissions or access scope to "make it work" — access scope is a security decision: narrowest scope, named approver, review date. Write the handoff with the classified cause and steps; direct and record.

7. In the internal note, document the classification, ladder results, security check outcome, and handoff. Client-facing wording per defensive-writing-standard.

Degradation: without documentation, the instance URL, version, and access policy may be unknown — say so. When in doubt, do nothing irreversible and escalate.
