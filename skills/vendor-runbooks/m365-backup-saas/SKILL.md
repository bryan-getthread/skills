# M365 SaaS Backup

Generic vendor runbook for SaaS-backup products protecting Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace tenants (the pattern is shared across the common MSP-market products). Two recurring ticket shapes dominate: restore requests (an authorization and scoping problem before it is a technical one) and license-count reconciliation (the silent-failure mode where new users are simply never protected). Job failures follow backup-failure-triage. Verify per-product specifics against the vendor's current documentation.

## When to use

- Someone asks to restore a mailbox, OneDrive/Drive files, SharePoint site, or Teams data "as of <date>"
- Protected-seat counts need reconciling against the tenant's actual users (billing or coverage audit)
- A SaaS-backup job failure or "unprotected user" alert lands

## Steps

1. Restore requests — authorization before mechanics:
   - Verify the requester per the identity ladder: is this the data owner, or someone authorized for another user's data? Restores of ANOTHER person's mailbox/files (including departed employees) require the client's authorized approver on file (search_itglue / search_contacts) — a manager wanting a subordinate's mail is a data-access decision the client makes, not the desk. Record who authorized it.
   - Scope the restore precisely: what objects (mailbox folder, specific files, site), point-in-time target date, and restore destination — in-place (overwrites/merges with current data) vs restore-to-alternate location or export. Prefer non-destructive targets unless the requester explicitly needs in-place; state the merge/overwrite behavior before the technician runs it.
   - Confirm a restore point actually exists at the requested date for the requested object BEFORE promising anything — retention windows and when protection started for that user bound what is recoverable. If the need traces to deletion/ransomware/compromise, branch to the security side first (compromised-account-containment / phishing-triage) so the restore doesn't re-import or mask evidence.
   - The restore is the technician's console action; the agent scopes, verifies authorization, and records object/date/destination/who-approved.
2. License-count reconciliation — the coverage audit:
   - Pull three numbers: seats licensed with the backup vendor, users actually configured for protection, and current active users in the tenant (the technician exports the latter from the admin center; the agent reconciles).
   - Classify the gaps: active users NOT protected (the dangerous gap — typically new hires when auto-add isn't on; every one is unrecoverable data accruing daily), protected accounts that no longer exist or are departed (paying for ghosts — but check the client's retention intent for departed-user data before recommending removal, since deleting the protection often deletes the backups), and licensed-but-unassigned seats (billing slack).
   - Recommend: enable/verify auto-add for new users where the product supports it; align seat count at the next billing cycle; document departed-user retention decisions with the client's approver. Route commercial changes to account management.
3. Job failures / unprotected-object alerts → backup-failure-triage logic: classify (auth/token expiry against the tenant is the SaaS-specific classic — reconsent/service-account fix; API throttling; object-type limits), check recurrence via search_tickets, and end with the exposure statement: last successful backup per affected object.
4. Document: for restores — requester, authorization, scope, point-in-time, destination, result; for reconciliation — the three numbers, gaps by name-count (not names in client-facing summaries), and recommendations with dates.

## Guardrails

- No restore of another user's data without the client's documented approver — urgency does not waive authorization, and the request channel is not proof of identity.
- Never run (or recommend) an in-place restore without stating the overwrite/merge consequence first; default to alternate-location/export when in doubt.
- Never promise recoverability before confirming a restore point exists for that object at that date — retention and protection-start bound the truth.
- Unprotected active users are an exposure finding with a daily-growing cost — flag loudly, never bury in a billing note.
- Removing protection from departed users may destroy their backups — retention decision first, seat cleanup second.
- "Microsoft/Google keeps our data" is not a backup — if a client declines SaaS backup, that is their documented decision via account management, not a triage argument.
- Console actions are technician steps the agent directs and records; results are stated per-object, honestly, including result caps on large reconciliations.
