# Axcient Backup Alerts

Vendor specialization of backup-failure-triage for Axcient x360Recover. The deployment split drives everything: appliance-based sites (local appliance + cloud replication — two failure surfaces) vs Direct-to-Cloud/D2C endpoints (agent straight to Axcient's cloud — one surface, but fully dependent on the endpoint's own connectivity and change rate). Identify which model the client runs before classifying anything. Verify product specifics against Axcient's current documentation.

## When to use

- An x360Recover backup failure, health, or replication alert lands as a ticket
- A D2C-protected laptop/server shows stale backups
- Someone asks whether retention/rollup is actually keeping the points the client's design promises

## Steps

1. Identify the protection model for the affected system (search_itglue for the client's backup design; the alert's source usually tells you): appliance-based or Direct-to-Cloud. Record it — the failure families and the exposure math differ.
2. Appliance-based failure families:
   - Local job failures → classify per backup-failure-triage (VSS/snapshot errors on the protected machine, credentials, appliance storage pressure, agent/version issues); check the protected machine's state via get_ninjaone_device / activities.
   - Replication/offsite lag → same site-loss framing as any local+cloud BCDR: quantify how far the cloud is behind the appliance and classify the cause (bandwidth, change rate, appliance health). Persistent growth = design problem ticket.
   - Appliance health alerts (storage, services) → the appliance is a single point for local recovery; treat degraded appliance storage as urgent capacity work, and never "fix" it by ad-hoc deletion of recovery points.
3. Direct-to-Cloud failure families:
   - Stale/no recent backup → endpoint-side first: device offline or off-network for the window (roaming laptops are the classic benign cause — check last-seen via the RMM), agent service stopped, or bandwidth caps. A laptop that travels is expected to lag; a server on D2C that lags is an incident.
   - Repeated agent errors → agent version/health on the endpoint; reinstalls are technician actions.
   - Wholesale failures across many D2C endpoints at once → possible service-side incident: check Axcient's status channels before endpoint-by-endpoint work, and say so in the note.
4. Retention verification: confirm the points that exist match the client's documented retention design — daily/intra-daily recent points, and the monthly/long-term points the rollup policy should be preserving. Spot-check the oldest expected point: if the design says a year and the oldest recoverable point is 60 days, that is a silent failure of the promise regardless of green daily jobs. Discrepancies are flagged to service leadership with dates — retention policy changes are never made from a triage ticket.
5. Recurrence per backup-failure-triage (search_tickets, same system + failure class, 30–90 days) — third same-class failure = problem ticket.
6. End every note with the exposure statement: last recoverable point (and for appliance sites, both local and cloud positions), plus whether the point is verified (AutoVerify/boot-check result where the deployment provides one — an unverified point is stated as unverified).
7. Handle-here vs escalate per the generic skill; escalate to Axcient support with: protection model, agent/appliance versions, exact error text, job history around the failure, and what was ruled out.

## Guardrails

- Never triage a D2C endpoint like an appliance site — "the appliance is fine" is meaningless for D2C, and "the laptop was closed all week" is a real explanation that still gets verified, not assumed.
- Retention shortfalls are design/contract findings — flag with evidence, never adjust retention or delete points from a triage seat.
- All backup-failure-triage guardrails apply: no data-safety or restore-will-work claims (report last-good and verification status only), alerts stay as the evidence trail, recurring failures never close as one-offs.
- Fleet-wide simultaneous failures → check for a product-side incident before burning hours per-endpoint.
- The agent has no Axcient console access; portal checks, verifications, and reinstalls are technician actions the agent directs and records.
