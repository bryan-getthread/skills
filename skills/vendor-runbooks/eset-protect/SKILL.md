# ESET PROTECT

Vendor specialization of security-alert-response and edr-detection-runbook for ESET PROTECT (cloud or on-prem console). ESET's distinctive traits for a service desk: cloud-sandbox verdicts that can hold files in limbo, and a layered policy model whose merge order quietly produces protection-status alarms that are configuration artifacts, not attacks. Verify feature names against ESET's current documentation — they evolve.

## When to use

- An ESET detection, firewall/HIPS event, or protection-status alert arrives as a ticket
- A user reports a file or download "stuck" or blocked and LiveGuard analysis is suspected
- A "protection disabled / product not activated / policy not applied" alarm needs triage

## Steps

1. Identify which layer fired — it sets confidence and next step: real-time/on-demand antimalware (signature + ML, high confidence), HIPS (behavioral/self-defense, more false-positive-prone with LOB software), network/web protection (blocked URL or exploit attempt — a signal something tried to reach a bad destination), and EDR detections where ESET Inspect is deployed (work correlated incidents, not single events).
2. Parse anatomy per security-vendor-generic and route per security-alert-response using the console's company/group context — multi-tenant consoles mix clients; low routing confidence → flag for a human, no reassignment.
3. LiveGuard verdict handling: ESET LiveGuard Advanced submits unknown files to a cloud sandbox and can block execution until a verdict returns. Branch on verdict: malicious → treat as a live detection per edr-detection-runbook (the file reached the endpoint; scope where else it landed); suspicious → do not release, escalate for technician review with the sandbox report; clean-but-was-held → the user-facing "blocked file" complaint resolves itself, note the delay window honestly. Never bypass a pending analysis to unblock a user — waiting minutes is cheaper than releasing a payload.
4. Protection-status alarms — run the policy-conflict check before assuming compromise or agent failure: ESET applies multiple policies in a merge order, and a later policy overriding an earlier one (or a local setting flagged against an applied policy) commonly produces "protection disabled," "settings not applied," or paused-protection states. Have the technician check the applied-policies list and effective settings on the device before reinstalling agents or declaring tampering. Genuine tamper indicators (service killed, self-defense triggered, uninstall attempted) escalate as security events instead.
5. Detections with action "cleaned/quarantined" get the standard verification pass: confirm in console, scope siblings by hash across the client, check persistence, identity involvement → compromised-account-containment. Detect-only → contain first; isolation (where the license provides it) is a technician action the agent directs and records.
6. Document layer, verdict, policy-conflict findings if any, and decisions with approvers; classify per soc-classification-tree. Recurring false alarms from policy drift feed security-noise-tuning; client-facing wording per defensive-writing-standard.

## Guardrails

- Never release or exclude a file awaiting a LiveGuard verdict; never convert "user needs it urgently" into a clean verdict.
- Policy-conflict alarms are cheap to check and expensive to misread in either direction — verify effective settings before both "it's fine" and "we're compromised."
- Exclusions are security decisions: narrowest scope, named approver, review date — HIPS exclusions especially, since they blind the behavioral layer.
- "Cleaned" covers the object, not the incident — scope before closing.
- The agent has no ESET console access: quarantine, isolation, policy edits, and exclusion changes are technician steps the agent directs and records.
- Degradation: without documentation access, the client's policy hierarchy is unknown — say so and have the tech read effective settings from the device.
