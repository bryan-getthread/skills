# Huntress ITDR Alerts

Vendor specialization of security-alert-response and impossible-travel-runbook for Huntress identity (ITDR / Managed Identity) reports. The generic runbooks own the investigation logic; this skill adds what is specific to how Huntress packages, escalates, and remediates identity incidents. Verify feature names and portal layout against Huntress's current documentation — they evolve.

## When to use

- A Huntress incident report or signal email lands as a ticket mentioning unwanted access, a suspicious login, a rogue/malicious inbox or OAuth application, or a mail-rule anomaly
- A tech asks "what do I do with this Huntress identity alert?"
- A Huntress remediation is pending approval and someone wants a second opinion

## Steps

1. Parse the Huntress report anatomy: severity (Huntress tiers reports roughly Low/High/Critical), affected identity (UPN), the M365 tenant it belongs to, the indicator detail (sign-in IP/location/ISP, application ID and consent scope for rogue apps, or the created rule's conditions/actions for rule anomalies), timestamps, and — critically — the report's own "remediation" section stating what Huntress recommends or has already done.
2. Route to the correct client using the tenant/domain/UPN fields per security-alert-response — Huntress reports often arrive on a shared alert-intake mailbox. Low routing confidence → no reassignment, flag for a human.
3. Separate contained-already from needs-action: Huntress ITDR reports typically state whether the identity was already isolated (sign-in disabled / sessions revoked by Huntress) or whether remediation is awaiting MSP approval in the Huntress portal. Do not re-plan containment that already happened; do not assume containment that is only recommended.
4. Branch by alert family:
   - Unwanted access / suspicious login → run the impossible-travel-runbook verification ladder: VPN/egress plausibility from documentation (search_itglue), prior context (search_tickets, same user + type, 90 days), then verify with the user by a number on file — never contact details from the ticket.
   - Rogue app / malicious OAuth consent → treat the consent as the compromise vector: who consented, when, what scopes (mail read/write scopes are the dangerous ones). User confirmation that they "clicked approve on something" supports the malicious verdict, not the benign one. Removal of the app consent is a tenant-admin action the technician executes.
   - Rule anomaly (inbox rule created) → continue with inbox-rule-alert-runbook; forwarding/deleting rules pointed at security-relevant mail are treated as attacker cleanup until disproven.
5. Drive the approval flow: if Huntress is waiting on remediation approval, the decision belongs to the technician in the Huntress portal — the agent's job is to assemble the evidence for or against approving, state a recommendation with reasoning, and record who approved what and when. Confirmed-compromise verdicts also branch to compromised-account-containment to cover anything outside Huntress's remediation scope (MFA re-registration, password reset, downstream app sessions).
6. Document the decision, not just the action: report severity, evidence weighed, user-verification outcome, what Huntress did vs what the tech did, and classify per soc-classification-tree.

## Guardrails

- Huntress "remediated" is not "case closed" — their action covers the identity event they saw; scope-check mail rules, OAuth grants, and MFA methods before closing.
- Never approve a remediation dismissal (marking a report as expected/benign) without the same evidence bar the generic runbook demands — a dismissed true positive silently disappears.
- Verify with the user via a number on file, never via the possibly-compromised mailbox.
- When in doubt, approve containment — a falsely disabled sign-in is cheap to undo; a missed takeover isn't.
- The agent has no Huntress console access: portal actions (approve remediation, dismiss report, review the identity timeline) are technician steps the agent directs and records.
- Defensive writing in anything client-facing: "a suspicious sign-in was investigated and contained," never "hacked" or "breach."
- Degradation: without documentation access, VPN egress ranges may be unknown — say so and lean harder on direct user verification.
