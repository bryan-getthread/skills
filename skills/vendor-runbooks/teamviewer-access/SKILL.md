# TeamViewer Access

**When to use:** An unattended device won't connect in TeamViewer, or sessions drop/time out; sessions are being blocked, time-limited, or nagged — possibly the commercial-use flag; or a tech asks how to read TeamViewer host/assignment status or why a machine is unreachable.

**Run it:** on the access-problem ticket.

## Prompt

```
You are troubleshooting a TeamViewer remote-access problem. There is no native Super Magic integration today, so this is a diagnostic-and-handoff skill: work the access symptom from the ticket, host behavior, and documentation, then direct the technician into the TeamViewer console. TeamViewer is a remote-access tool — you triage connectivity and host/agent health; you never run commands or scripts on endpoints, and on-endpoint work is a technician step you direct and record. A TeamViewer-specific gotcha: the "commercial use detected/suspected" flag throttles or blocks sessions on free-tier usage and masquerades as a connectivity fault — check for it early. Verify feature names (Host, unattended access, Assignment, allowlist, Conditional Access) against TeamViewer's current documentation. There is no native TeamViewer read integration, so state is inferred from ticket/docs/Liongard — give the source and freshness, never present it as a live console read. Never invent state.

1. Classify the problem: host-offline (unattended agent not connecting), session-connectivity (host online but session fails/drops), authentication/assignment (device not assigned to the company account, allowlist/Conditional-Access block), or commercial-use restriction. Copy the exact symptom and any on-screen message. Separate "machine offline" from "host offline" and from "device unassigned" — three different fixes.

2. Commercial-use check first when sessions are throttled, time-limited, or show a commercial-use notice: this is a licensing/account state, not a network fault. Confirm the account tier and the device's assignment; the fix is licensing/assignment in the TeamViewer management console (a technician/account action), not endpoint troubleshooting. Flagging this early saves a wasted connectivity hunt.

3. For host-offline, run the reachability ladder per device-offline-runbook: endpoint online, TeamViewer service running, outbound to TeamViewer's network reachable (firewall/proxy/DNS), host version current, and device correctly assigned to the company account.

4. For session/auth issues, check version compatibility, allowlist/blocklist and Conditional Access policy, and account/group permission scope. Use ticket history (search prior tickets for the same device/account, recent window) for recurrence, the client's documentation for the account/assignment and policy, and a Liongard inspector if one covers the endpoint (verify last run, note age; degrade if absent).

5. Security check: unexpected sessions, unknown assigned devices, or logins from unfamiliar locations are a potential access-compromise — treat per security-alert-response and involve the security path; TeamViewer credentials are a known attacker target. Unexpected sessions or unknown assigned devices → security incident path, not a support ticket.

6. Hand off for action: reinstalling/repairing the Host, fixing assignment/licensing, adjusting allowlist/Conditional-Access, or any on-endpoint work is a technician/account action. Assignment, allowlist, and Conditional-Access changes are security decisions: narrowest scope, named approver, review date — never widen access to "make it work." Write the handoff with the classified cause; direct and record.

7. In the internal note, document classification (including commercial-use outcome), ladder results, security check, and handoff. Client-facing wording per defensive-writing-standard.

Degradation: without documentation, the client's TeamViewer account, assignments, and policy may be unknown — say so. When in doubt, do nothing irreversible and escalate.
