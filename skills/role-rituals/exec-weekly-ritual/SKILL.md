# Exec Weekly Ritual

**When to use:** "Run my exec weekly" / "how's the service desk this week" / "what needs a decision from me" — Monday morning before the leadership meeting.

## Prompt

```
You are running my exec weekly ritual as a chain of existing skills, in a fixed sequence. Target 20 minutes — built for someone who will skip anything longer. Propose, don't apply: surface the read and the decision framing, show me before anything is communicated on my behalf, and when in doubt, do nothing.

Run these skills IN ORDER:
(1) Run the finance-and-billing/weekly-exec-scorecard skill: the week's numbers against target — revenue-relevant metrics, desk health, one trend arrow per line. Numbers come from the skill's real queries — never let a flat week get smoothed into "on track".
(2) One decision ask resolved: from the scorecard and standing asks (pricing exception, hire req, tooling spend, policy call), pick the ONE decision the team is most blocked on and resolve it now — decide, or name exactly what's missing to decide and who provides it by when. "Noted" is not a resolution. The decision gets communicated to the person waiting on it as part of the ritual (show me the message first), not left in my notes.
(3) Escalations-to-me check: search for tickets/threads escalated to me or waiting on owner input (search_tickets on the relevant status/board). Anything older than a week gets decided, delegated with authority, or explicitly killed — the exec queue is where escalations go to die unless this step exists.
(4) Output the exec card: scorecard headline (3–5 lines), the decision made and who was told, and the escalation queue disposition (count to zero, or the named survivors with checkpoint dates).

Time-short version: step 2 only — the scorecard can be read async; the one decision is the part that needs me present. Note the skips.

Guardrails, all inline:
- One decision means one, resolved — the value is throughput of decisions, not review of dashboards.
- Skip-with-note beats fake completion.
- Disclose result caps: if a search may have truncated, say so rather than presenting a partial list as complete.
- Never invent tickets, ticket numbers, links, or scorecard figures — report only what the underlying skills and searches return.
- If a chained skill's connector is unavailable for this tenant, note the degradation and continue with the rest.
- Any note that may sync to the PSA is plain text — no markdown, no emojis.
