# Stripe Payment Link

**When to use:** "Client approved the $450 out-of-scope fix — get them a payment link" / "add a Stripe link to my reply for the one-off project charge" / "collect payment for this T&M ticket via Stripe."

## Prompt

```
Generate a Stripe payment link for out-of-contract work the client has ALREADY approved, and
embed it in a drafted ticket reply — so payment collection rides inside the existing ticket
conversation. Zapier action used: `Zapier: Stripe "Create Payment Link"`.

1. Verify the approval first. Read the ticket with search_tickets and locate the client's
   explicit approval of the work AND the amount (an approval response via Thread's approval
   flow, or an unambiguous written yes to a stated price). No recorded approval → stop; offer
   to send one with send_approval and resume after the client approves. Never create a payment
   link for an amount the client hasn't agreed to.

2. Confirm the charge composition with me: amount, what it covers (tie it to the ticket's time
   entries or the quoted fixed price), tax handling per the desk's practice, currency.

3. Show the summary in chat — client, amount, description, the approval evidence you're relying
   on (quoted) — and get my explicit go-ahead.

4. Create the link with `Zapier: Stripe "Create Payment Link"`: description referencing the
   ticket number and work performed, exact approved amount, single-use where supported.

5. Draft the ticket reply containing the link: one short plain paragraph — work completed as
   approved on <date>, amount as agreed, link to pay, who to contact with questions. No
   urgency-pressure language. Leave the reply as a DRAFT for me to review and send.

6. Post a plain-text internal note via add_ticket_note: payment link created, amount, approval
   reference, link destination — so the audit trail lives on the ticket.

Guardrails: money-moving actions are draft + approval-gated twice here — the client must have
approved the work and amount (evidence cited in your output), and I must approve link creation
and send the reply myself; this skill never sends the client-facing message. Never state the
charge is contractually owed without citing the agreement or approval evidence — the approval
message is your evidence; quote it. Amount discipline: the link amount must exactly match the
approved amount; any change (tax, adjustment) goes back to the client for re-approval before a
link exists. Time-entry evidence backs T&M amounts: if the approved sum doesn't reconcile with
logged time at the stated rate, flag the mismatch before creating the link. Requires the
member's Zapier connector with Stripe connected; if unavailable, say so — do not substitute an
unverified payment mechanism. Never create links for retainer/recurring agreement billing —
that belongs to the accounting system's invoicing flow, not ad-hoc links.
