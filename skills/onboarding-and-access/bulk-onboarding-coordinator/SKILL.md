# Bulk Onboarding Coordinator

Keeps a hiring wave from becoming ten interleaved messes: one parent ticket
owns the wave, each hire gets their own child ticket running the standard
onboarding, and a consolidated status table on the parent shows the whole wave
at a glance.

## When to use

- "We have 8 new starters on the 1st — here's the list."
- An acquisition, new office, or seasonal class lands as one big request.
- Several individual onboarding tickets for the same client and start window
  should be coordinated as a wave.
- "Where are we on the <client> hiring wave?"

## Steps

1. Parse the wave request into a per-hire roster: name, start date, role,
   department, manager, location, hardware, special requests. Run each row
   through Onboarding Form Intake validation (missing fields = MISSING, never
   guessed). Confirm the roster back to the requester before creating anything
   — one wrong spreadsheet column becomes N wrong accounts.
2. Create the parent ticket (create_ticket) for the wave: client, start
   date(s), hire count, requester, and the roster. This is the coordination
   and status surface, not a work ticket.
3. Create one child ticket per hire (create_ticket), titled to the client's
   convention, each referencing the parent ticket number and carrying that
   hire's Required / Conditional / Optional checklist per New Hire Onboarding.
   Cross-link: list every child ticket number on the parent. Each child runs
   the standard New Hire Onboarding skill — all of its guardrails (role-based
   access, approvals for cost, secure credential handling, 48-hour priority
   bump per hire) apply per hire, not once for the wave.
4. Batch what is honestly batchable, keep per-hire what is not: one license
   purchase approval may cover the wave's counted total (License Lifecycle
   note on the parent); hardware may ship as one order. Credentials,
   verification, and MFA enrollment are strictly per hire — never share a
   temporary password across hires or reuse a pattern-guessable sequence.
5. Maintain the consolidated status table as a plain-text note on the parent
   (re-post updated, plain text only — PSA sync; a fixed-width table reads
   fine): one row per hire — name, child ticket, account, licenses, groups,
   hardware, MFA, credential handoff — each cell Done / Pending / Blocked.
   Update on every meaningful child change or on the requested cadence.
6. Escalate wave-level risks on the parent: hires whose start date is within
   48 hours with Blocked items, roster changes from the client mid-wave (added
   or dropped hires get an explicit note, and a dropped hire's child ticket is
   closed with any created access rolled back per Employee Offboarding order).
7. When every child completes: final status table, wave summary to the
   requester with anything still pending (e.g., hardware in transit), and
   log time (log_time_entry) on the parent.

## Guardrails

- Confirm the roster with the requester before creating child tickets; never
  provision from an unconfirmed spreadsheet.
- Every per-hire guardrail from New Hire Onboarding holds inside the wave —
  bulk is a coordination pattern, not a shortcut past approvals or secure
  credential handoffs.
- Never reuse or sequence temporary passwords across the wave.
- The status table reports child-ticket reality; do not mark a hire Done on
  the parent while their child ticket has open items.
- If the wave exceeds what can be tracked reliably in one table (very large
  waves), split into batched parents by start date rather than letting one
  table go stale.
