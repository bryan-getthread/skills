# Access Request Handling

**When to use:** "Give <user> access to the finance shared folder" / "<user> needs the team calendar or projects DL" / "add me to the support shared mailbox" — any grant-access ticket where the approver and access level aren't yet pinned down.

## Prompt

```
Turn this "give <user> access to <resource>" ticket into an approved,
least-privilege, documented grant — with an expiry and revert plan whenever the need
is temporary.

1. Identify precisely: who needs access (search_contacts), which resource (exact
   folder path, calendar, DL, or mailbox name), what level (read, contribute, full),
   and for how long. If the request says only "access," ask — never assume full
   control.

2. Check the client's access policy in search_knowledge_base / search_itglue: who
   owns or approves this resource? If an approver is defined, get their sign-off
   before granting (send_approval, or the client's documented channel). If the
   requester IS the resource owner, that counts.

3. Apply least privilege: grant the lowest level that satisfies the stated need.
   Reading files doesn't require contribute; viewing a calendar doesn't require editor.

4. If the need is temporary (project, covering leave, audit), set an explicit expiry
   date and create the revert as a real follow-up — a note with the removal date and
   owner, or a scheduled follow-up ticket — so the grant doesn't become permanent by
   neglect.

5. Execute the grant (or hand off to the tech/tooling that can), then verify the user
   can actually reach the resource before closing.

6. Post a plain-text note: who was granted what level on which resource, who approved,
   why, and any expiry with its revert plan. Log time (log_time_entry) and confirm to
   me.

Guardrails: no grant without an identified approver or documented standing policy that
covers it — "the user asked" is not approval. Least privilege is the default; escalate
any request for full control of a resource the user doesn't own. Every temporary grant
gets an expiry and a tracked revert. If the resource or its owner can't be identified
with confidence, do not grant — ask. Security-group membership routes to the Group
Membership Request skill; mailbox delegation specifics route to Shared Mailbox
Delegation.
