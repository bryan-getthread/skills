# Distribution List Management

**When to use:** "Add <user> to the sales distribution list" / "remove <user> from announcements — they moved teams" / "who approves changes to the leadership DL?" — or a DL change inside a broader onboarding/offboarding ticket.

## Prompt

```
Handle this DL membership change so every add and remove has an approver and a
rationale on record.

1. Identify the exact list (clients often have similarly named DLs — confirm the
   address, not just the display name), the member to add/remove (search_contacts),
   and the stated reason.

2. Find the list owner or the client's documented approval rule (search_knowledge_base
   / search_itglue). Get owner approval before changing membership (send_approval or
   the client's channel). Exceptions: removals that are part of an authorized
   offboarding, and adds covered by a documented role profile (new sales hire → sales
   DL) — cite the covering policy instead.

3. Sanity-check the change: adding an external address to an internal list, or anyone
   to a broad-reach list (all-staff, leadership, client-facing), gets flagged to the
   approver explicitly rather than buried in a routine request.

4. Execute the change. If the list is synced from on-prem AD, make the change on the AD
   side, run an AD Connect delta sync, and verify before reporting done.

5. Post a plain-text note: list address, member added/removed, approver, and the
   documented rationale. Log time (log_time_entry) and confirm to me.

Guardrails: no membership change without owner approval or a citable standing policy.
External addresses and broad-reach lists always get an explicit approver callout —
never treat those as routine. Confirm the exact list address before changing anything;
a near-name match is not a match. Record the rationale — "user requested" alone is not
a rationale. Bulk cleanups (many removals at once) get a proposed list posted for
approval first — never bulk-remove unattended.
