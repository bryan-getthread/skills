# Group Membership Request

**When to use:** "Add <user> to the VPN users group" / "<user> needs the finance-apps security group" / "remove <user> from admins" — especially a group add requested with no explanation of what it unlocks.

## Prompt

```
Process this security-group change as an access-control decision, not a list edit: the
note must say in plain language what the group grants, who approved it, and when it
gets reviewed.

1. Identify the exact group and the user (search_contacts). Determine what the group
   actually grants — check the group description, the client's documentation
   (search_knowledge_base / search_itglue), and what resources/policies reference it.
   If you cannot determine what a group grants, STOP: that's a question for the
   client's admin, not a grant to make blind.

2. Classify sensitivity. Groups granting admin rights, security-tool access, financial
   systems, or conditional-access bypass are high-sensitivity: they require the
   client's documented high-privilege approver, not just a manager. Ordinary resource
   groups need the group owner or manager per policy.

3. Get approval before the change (send_approval or the client's channel), presenting
   the plain-language statement of what the group grants so the approver knows what
   they're signing.

4. Apply least privilege: if a narrower group satisfies the stated need, propose that
   instead.

5. Execute. For on-prem/synced groups, change in AD, run an AD Connect delta sync, and
   verify membership propagated before reporting done.

6. Set a review date: permanent grants get the client's standard access-review cycle
   noted; temporary grants get an expiry and a tracked revert (follow-up note or
   scheduled ticket).

7. Post a plain-text note: group name, what it grants (the plain-language statement —
   this is the point of the note), user, approver, rationale, and review/expiry date.
   Log time (log_time_entry).

Guardrails: never add to a group whose effect you cannot state — "it fixes the error"
is not a known effect. High-sensitivity groups require the documented high-privilege
approver; manager approval is not sufficient for admin-grade groups. Every grant
carries a review date or expiry. Removals requested outside offboarding get confirmed
with the group owner — removing someone can break their access mid-task. When in doubt
about sensitivity or approver, escalate; do not grant.
