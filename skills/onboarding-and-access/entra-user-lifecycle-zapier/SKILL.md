# Entra User Lifecycle (Zapier)

**When to use:** "Create the Entra account for <user> per the onboarding ticket" / "disable <user> in Entra now — offboarding effective today" / "update <user>'s title/department/manager in Entra" — an onboarding, offboarding, or user-update ticket where the desk executes Entra changes itself via the Zapier connector.

## Prompt

```
Execute Entra ID account writes from this ticket via Zapier — with the one hard
constraint designed in: Zapier's Entra integration can write users but cannot SEARCH
them, so identity must be fully resolved on the PSA/ticket side before any write.

1. Confirm the connector: the acting member must have the Zapier MCP connected with the
   Microsoft Entra ID app authorized for this client's tenant. If unavailable, degrade
   to producing the exact change specification as a plain-text note for a tech to
   execute manually — never pretend the write happened.

2. Resolve identity from the PSA side FIRST. There is no user search in Entra via
   Zapier. Build the full identity from search_contacts, search_clients, the ticket,
   and client documentation (search_itglue / search_knowledge_base): exact UPN/email,
   display name, and for updates/disables the unambiguous existing user identifier. If
   the UPN cannot be established with certainty, STOP and ask — a write against a
   guessed UPN can hit the wrong person or create a duplicate.

3. For creates, also resolve: naming convention (from client docs), department, title,
   manager, usage location (required before licensing), and the role-based groups per
   New Hire Onboarding. Check for collisions using PSA contact records and
   documentation (Entra can't be searched) — state in the note that collision checking
   was PSA-side only.

4. Approval gate before EVERY write, no exceptions: post the exact intended change
   (action, target UPN, fields/values or groups) and get sign-off via send_approval or
   the client's documented channel. One approval may cover one ticket's coherent change
   set, but never carries over to a second user or a later ticket.

5. Execute via the corresponding Zapier action — `Zapier: Microsoft Entra ID
   "Create User"`, `"Update User"`, `"Disable User"`, or the group-membership actions —
   one logical change at a time. Sequencing rules from the sibling skills still bind:
   for offboarding, mailbox handling precedes license removal; for hybrid tenants,
   on-prem AD is the source of authority — do not write cloud-side against a synced
   object; make the change in AD and run an AD Connect delta sync instead.

6. Verify by EFFECT, not by search (there is none): confirm through an observable
   outcome — user appears in the licensing/billing view, sign-in behaves as expected,
   or a tech eyeballs the portal. Then post a plain-text note: action, target, approver,
   Zapier action used, verification method, outcome. Log time (log_time_entry).

Guardrails: no Entra write without the approval gate — including "small" updates. Never
guess a UPN; unresolvable identity = no write. Never Delete User as part of routine
offboarding — Disable is the offboarding action; deletion only on explicit documented
client instruction after retention windows. Passwords set at creation follow the canon:
secure transfer only, change forced at next sign-in, never in the ticket or email. On
any Zapier error or ambiguous result, do not retry blind — report the exact state as
unknown and have it verified before a second attempt (a retried create makes
duplicates). Do not write cloud-side attributes on objects mastered in on-prem AD.

Running unattended (Flows): not eligible for unattended writes. If invoked from a Flow,
produce only the proposed change specification as a plain-text note ending "PENDING
APPROVAL — no changes made"; a human approves and triggers execution. When identity
resolution fails, output nothing and stop.
