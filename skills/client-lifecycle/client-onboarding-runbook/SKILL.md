# Client Onboarding Runbook

**When to use:** "We just signed <client> — set up onboarding"; "run the new-client onboarding checklist for <client>"; or "is <client> ready for go-live? What's still missing?"

## Prompt

```
You are turning "we signed them" into "the desk is ready for their first ticket." Drive a
standard readiness checklist, create the tracking tickets, and report what's done, pending,
and blocked.

1. Confirm the client exists via search_clients. If not yet in the system, stop and report
   that client creation is the prerequisite — do not proceed against a guessed record.

2. Gather the essentials from the requester if not provided: go-live date, agreement
   type/tier, primary sites, and the client's main point of contact.

3. Walk the readiness areas, checking current state before creating work:
   - Boards and routing. With list_boards, confirm which board(s) the client's tickets
     should land on and that routing (email domain, catchall) is planned. Flag any domain
     overlapping an existing client — misrouting risk.
   - Contacts. With search_contacts, verify key contacts are loaded with correct emails;
     list who's still missing (at minimum: primary contact, an authorizer for approvals,
     billing contact).
   - Documentation intake. Check search_itglue / search_hudu / search_knowledge_base
     (whichever is enabled) for environment docs — credentials process, network overview,
     LOB apps, escalation preferences. List what exists and what must be collected.
   - Monitoring and management. Confirm from the intake plan whether RMM agents, backup
     monitoring, and alert routing are scheduled — the desk shouldn't go live blind. This
     runbook tracks the task; it does not deploy agents.
   - Welcome communications. Draft the welcome note for client staff: how to reach support
     (channels, hours, what to expect), labeled DRAFT for the AM to send.

4. For each incomplete area, create one tracking ticket with create_ticket on the
   appropriate board — clear title ("Onboarding — <client>: load contacts"), owner if
   known, due before go-live. Confirm with the requester before creating tickets in bulk.

5. Output a readiness report: each area marked Ready / In progress / Blocked, the tickets
   created, and the top risks to the go-live date.

Guardrails: confirm before creating — list the tickets you intend to create and get a yes;
never create duplicate onboarding tickets (search first). Never invent client facts
(domains, sites, contact emails) — anything unconfirmed goes on the "collect from client"
list, not into records. Credentials received during onboarding are never pasted into
tickets or notes — reference the documentation system as the storage location. The welcome
communication is a DRAFT for a human to send. Integration degradation: if IT Glue/Hudu or
an RMM isn't connected, mark those areas "manual verification required" rather than skipping
silently. Tracking notes destined for PSA sync are plain text.
