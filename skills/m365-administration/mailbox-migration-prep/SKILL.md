name: Mailbox Migration Prep
description: Build the pre-migration checklist for tenant-to-tenant or on-prem-to-cloud mailbox moves — full inventory, the list of things that break, holds and licensing checks, and the user comms plan. Use when a migration is being scoped or scheduled, before anyone touches a migration batch.

# Mailbox Migration Prep

Front-loads the pain of a mailbox migration: everything that will break is
listed before cutover, the inventory is complete enough to rebuild what the
move drops, and users hear about it before their Outlook does.

## When to use

- Scoping a tenant-to-tenant migration (acquisition, divestiture, rebrand).
- On-prem Exchange to Exchange Online onboarding.
- "What do we need to check before we migrate mailboxes?"
- Post-migration "X stopped working" tickets that trace back to skipped prep
  (use the checklist as the diagnostic).

## Steps

1. Inventory the source — this is the rebuild manifest. Have the tech export
   and attach (verify against current module versions):
   - Mailboxes with sizes and item counts (`Get-Mailbox` +
     `Get-MailboxStatistics`) — sizes drive batch planning and flag anything
     near target-side quotas.
   - Mailbox types: shared, room/equipment (with their CalendarProcessing
     policies — see resource-mailbox-setup), and which shared mailboxes are
     over 50 GB (they'll need licenses on the target).
   - All permission grants: Full Access, Send As, Send on Behalf, calendar
     grants (mailbox-permissions-audit is the collection playbook).
   - All forwarding, all three layers (mail-forwarding-audit).
   - Aliases/proxy addresses per mailbox, DLs and M365 Groups with membership
     and owners, transport rules, connectors, and DKIM/SPF/DMARC state.
   - Litigation/eDiscovery holds and retention policies — mailboxes under
     hold do NOT move without legal sign-off; migration can disturb
     preservation and that is a lawyer conversation, not a tech one
     (litigation-hold).
2. Write the "what breaks" list into the ticket — tenant-to-tenant breaks
   more than clients expect; state each with its mitigation:
   - Cross-mailbox permissions and calendar delegations: usually NOT
     migrated by tools — plan to re-grant from the step-1 inventory.
   - Outlook autocomplete / X500: replies to old cached entries bounce
     unless legacyExchangeDN values are stamped as X500 proxy addresses on
     target — put this in the plan explicitly; it is the number-one
     post-migration ticket generator.
   - Outlook profiles and mobile accounts: typically need recreation on
     cutover — that is desk workload; schedule for it.
   - Inbox rules referencing old addresses, mailbox-level forwards, and
     shared-mailbox mappings: re-verify post-move.
   - In-place archives (and especially auto-expanded archives — they migrate
     badly or not in one piece; see archive-mailbox-enablement) get their own
     line in the plan.
   - Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive content is NOT covered by a mailbox
     migration — scope it separately and say so, or the client will assume.
3. DNS and identity cutover plan: MX, autodiscover, SPF/DKIM/DMARC records
   for the moving domain (dkim-enablement on the target BEFORE cutover so
   outbound authentication never lapses); domain removal from the source
   tenant sequencing (a domain can only live in one tenant at a time —
   cutover order matters and drives the downtime window).
4. Comms plan — approval-gated because it is maximally user-visible: who is
   told what and when (dates, expected downtime, what users must do:
   re-add accounts, re-check signatures, expect autocomplete quirks), a
   freeze window for mailbox changes before cutover, and day-one hypercare
   staffing. Client sign-off on the schedule via send_approval.
5. Batch strategy: pilot group first (include one of every mailbox type),
   validation criteria for the pilot, then waves sized to bandwidth and
   desk capacity. Define the go/no-go and the rollback point (before MX
   cutover, rollback is cheap; after, it is a second migration — write that
   down).
6. Output: the prep checklist as a plain-text ticket note (inventory
   attached/referenced, what-breaks list with mitigations, DNS sequence,
   comms schedule, batch plan, holds flagged, license gaps on target), and
   the explicit list of open questions blocking a migration date. Log time.

## Guardrails

- Held mailboxes do not enter a batch without documented legal sign-off.
- Never promise permissions, delegations, or autocomplete will "just work"
  post-migration — plan their re-creation from the inventory.
- The inventory is evidence, attached to the ticket, not a claim that it
  was checked.
- Scope honesty: mailbox migration ≠ tenant migration; name what is out of
  scope (SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams) in the note.
- Migration tooling capabilities change — verify current tool behavior
  (what it does and does not carry) against vendor docs for the chosen tool
  rather than asserting from memory.
