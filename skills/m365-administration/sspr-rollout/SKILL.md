name: SSPR Rollout
description: Plan and execute self-service password reset enablement for a tenant — method choices, registration campaign, hybrid writeback checks — framed around the helpdesk-ticket impact it is meant to deliver. Use when a client asks to "let users reset their own passwords" or an SSPR rollout is proposed to cut password tickets.

# SSPR Rollout

SSPR is sold on one number: password-reset tickets that stop arriving. This
skill rolls it out so that number actually materializes — methods users will
register, a campaign that gets them registered, and a before/after measurement
so the client sees the payoff.

## When to use

- "Enable self-service password reset for <client>."
- "We spend too much helpdesk time on password resets" — SSPR is the proposal.
- SSPR is enabled but nobody uses it (registration problem, not a feature
  problem).
- Hybrid client asks for SSPR and on-prem passwords are in play.

## Steps

1. **Baseline the ticket load first.** search_tickets for password-reset
   volume for this client over the last 60–90 days (state the search window
   and note if results may be capped). This is the before-number; without it
   the rollout can never prove its value.
2. **Check the plumbing.** Cloud-only: straightforward. Hybrid (synced from
   AD): SSPR needs password writeback via Entra Connect and the appropriate
   licensing (Entra ID P1 or M365 Business Premium for writeback) — without
   writeback, cloud resets diverge from on-prem passwords, which is worse
   than no SSPR. Verify licensing and Entra Connect health before promising
   anything. State which case applies in the plan.
3. **Choose methods deliberately.** Require two methods for reset. Prefer
   Microsoft Authenticator (app notification/code) plus a secondary; avoid
   security questions (weak, guessable) unless the client insists in writing.
   Align with the tenant's MFA registration via combined registration so
   users register once for both MFA and SSPR — check the mfa-methods-audit
   skill's findings if one exists for this tenant; phone-only populations
   affect the method choice.
4. **Pilot, then broaden.** Enable SSPR for a pilot group; pilot users
   register and perform a real reset end-to-end (including on-prem sync for
   hybrid). Only then broaden. Note: admin accounts always have SSPR enforced
   by Microsoft with two-method requirements — do not count them as pilot
   evidence for the user experience.
5. **Run the registration campaign — this is the rollout.** Enablement
   without registration produces nothing. Prepare user comms (what's
   changing, why, how to register, how long it takes), use registration
   campaign/nudge features where licensed, and report registration coverage
   weekly until it plateaus. Expect a temporary bump in tickets about
   registration itself — tell the client this up front so week one doesn't
   read as failure.
6. **Approval and comms gate.** Before broad enablement: send_approval to the
   client contact with methods chosen, registration requirement users will
   see at next sign-in, the campaign plan, and rollback (disable SSPR scope;
   registered methods persist harmlessly).
7. **Measure and close the loop.** At 30/60 days post-rollout: registration
   coverage, SSPR usage count, and password-ticket volume vs the baseline
   from step 1. Post the comparison (dated, windows stated) — this is the
   deliverable the client was actually buying. Schedule the measurement
   follow-up (schedule_ticket) at rollout time so it happens.

## Guardrails

- Never enable SSPR for a hybrid tenant without verified password writeback
  and licensing — a working demo in the cloud and a broken on-prem password
  is a trust-destroying failure mode.
- Security questions are a documented-client-decision method, not a default.
- Do not promise ticket-volume reductions without the baseline measurement;
  present before/after with search windows stated and result-cap honesty.
- Helpdesk verification discipline still applies: SSPR reduces reset tickets;
  it does not change the identity-verification ladder for the resets that
  still reach a human (see password-and-mfa-recovery).
- Agent prepares plan, comms, and measurements; the technician executes the
  Entra configuration. Registration status figures are point-in-time — date
  them.
