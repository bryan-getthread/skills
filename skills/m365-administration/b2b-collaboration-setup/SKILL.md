description: Set up cross-tenant collaboration between a client and a partner organization — scoped cross-tenant access settings, MFA/device trust decisions, and a documented rollback. Use when a ticket asks to "let <partner org>'s users into our tenant", fix double-MFA for external users, or restrict which domains can be invited.

# B2B Collaboration Setup

**When to use:** A ticket asks to give a named partner organization's people access to the client's Teams/SharePoint, external users complain about MFA twice (home tenant and again as guest), someone wants guest invites restricted to approved partner domains, or you're reviewing existing cross-tenant settings during onboarding or an audit. Cross-tenant access settings are tenant-to-tenant trust decisions dressed up as collaboration convenience. This skill scopes the trust to the named partner, decides the MFA-trust question deliberately, and writes the rollback before anything is changed.

## Prompt

```
You are preparing a cross-tenant access change for a technician to execute in Entra. You scope the trust, decide the trust claims, and write the rollback; the tech reads current state and applies the change. Never mark the change as applied on intention, and never invent the current configuration — verify against Microsoft's current cross-tenant docs (web_search), as this settings surface changes frequently.

1. Intake — scope the actual need (search_tickets for context). Which partner organization (their tenant domain), which direction (their users into the client's tenant = inbound; client's users into theirs = outbound), which of the client's users/groups and apps are in scope, and for how long (project-bound or ongoing). "Everyone, everything, forever" is a red flag to push back on, not a requirement to implement.

2. Docs and current state. search_itglue / search_hudu / search_knowledge_base (skip gracefully if absent) for the client's external-collaboration standard. Tech reads the current cross-tenant access defaults and any existing org-specific entries — a partner may already be configured, and the fix is adjusting scope, not adding a duplicate.

3. Prefer an org-specific entry over loosening defaults. Add the partner tenant as a named organization in cross-tenant access settings and scope inbound access to the specific users/groups and applications requested. Never change tenant-wide cross-tenant defaults to satisfy a single-partner request — org-specific settings exist for exactly this; tenant-wide default changes affect every current and future external org and need their own justification and approval, separate from this request.

4. Decide the trust claims deliberately. The double-MFA fix is trusting MFA claims from the partner's home tenant. That is a real trust decision: the client is accepting the partner's MFA quality as their own. Reasonable for a known, managed partner; state it plainly in the approval. Trusting compliant-device or hybrid-join claims is a bigger step — only when the partner's device management is known and the client's CA policies depend on it; default to NOT trusting device claims. MFA-trust and device-trust decisions are named explicitly in the approval — they must never ride along silently in "set up the partner access."

5. Pair with invite hygiene. If the client wants domain restriction, set the collaboration allow/deny list to the approved partner domains — an allowlist is the durable posture; a denylist is whack-a-mole. Confirm this doesn't strand existing guests from other domains (cross-reference the guest-access-audit skill for who is already inside).

6. Approval gate. send_approval to the client's documented authority with: partner tenant, direction, scoped users/groups/apps, trust claims accepted (MFA yes/no, device claims yes/no), duration/review date, and the rollback — remove or restrict the org-specific entry, which cuts the partner's access cleanly without touching individual guests. Ongoing collaborations get a review date; project-bound ones get an end date and a tracked removal — trust without expiry is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

7. Verify and document. Test with one partner user: access works, and the MFA experience matches the decision made. Document what/why/when/rollback: plain-text note (add_ticket_note) with partner org, direction, scope, trust decisions, approver, review date, rollback steps. Store the full configuration record in IT Glue/Hudu.

When in doubt about the scope, direction, or a "trust everything" request, do nothing and escalate to the client's documented authority.
