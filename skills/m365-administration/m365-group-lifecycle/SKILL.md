description: Govern the full life of Microsoft 365 Groups — who can create them, naming, expiration/renewal, ownership, and clean retirement — and keep the group-vs-DL-vs-security-group decision straight. Use when a client asks to control group sprawl, set who can make groups/teams, handle expiring or ownerless groups, or clean up dead groups.

# M365 Group Lifecycle

Governs Microsoft 365 Groups from creation to retirement — creation
restrictions, naming, expiration, ownership, and clean deletion — because a
group is the backing object for Teams, a SharePoint site, a mailbox, and a
calendar all at once, so an ungoverned group is four kinds of sprawl.

## When to use

- "Who can create groups/teams, and can we restrict it?"
- "Set up group expiration / renewal."
- "We have ownerless and abandoned groups."
- "Retire this group cleanly."
- For picking the RIGHT object type in the first place, see
  distribution-vs-m365-groups; for Teams-specific naming/guest work,
  teams-governance (which shares this policy — keep them aligned).

## Steps

1. Frame the blast radius before setting policy. Every M365 Group carries a
   mailbox, a SharePoint site, a calendar, and (if a team) Teams — so
   lifecycle rules here ripple into all of those. Coordinate with
   teams-governance so naming/expiration are one policy, not two conflicting
   ones.
2. Creation control: decide whether any user can create groups (the default)
   or only an approved security group. Restricting creation is a common
   "stop the sprawl" ask — note it applies to all group-creating surfaces
   (Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, Planner) and needs the right directory
   setting. Keep a self-service request path so restriction doesn't just push
   people to shadow IT.
3. Naming policy: prefix/suffix convention + blocked-words list. State the
   prerequisites plainly — a naming policy requires Entra ID P1 for every
   affected user and applies to all groups tenant-wide. Existing groups are
   not renamed retroactively.
4. Expiration/renewal: set a group-expiration period; active groups can
   auto-renew based on activity, inactive ones are soft-deleted and
   recoverable for 30 days. Also requires Entra ID P1. The trap: an ownerless
   group can't be renewed by anyone and will expire — so fix ownership first
   (step 5) before switching expiration on.
5. Ownership hygiene: enforce a minimum of two owners per group; find and
   remediate ownerless groups by assigning owners (ask the client who owns
   each business function). Single-owner groups orphan the moment that person
   leaves.
6. Retirement: retire a dead group cleanly rather than leaving it to rot —
   confirm with the client the group and its workloads (mailbox, site, files)
   are truly unused, export/preserve anything needed, then delete (soft-delete
   is recoverable for 30 days). Never hard-assume a quiet group is dead.
7. Approval + execution. Creation restriction, naming, and expiration are
   tenant-wide and user-visible — get client sign-off (send_approval) with the
   policy specifics and any groups slated for retirement. Prepare execution
   for the tech (verify against current portals): Entra admin center group
   settings, `Set-AzureADDirectorySetting` / Microsoft Graph for naming and
   creation control, expiration policy in Entra, group deletion via admin
   center. Verify: new-group creation obeys the restriction/convention;
   expiration shows the agreed period; ownerless groups resolved; retired
   groups gone (and recoverable within 30 days). Post a plain-text note:
   policies set (creation control, convention, expiration period, licensing
   prerequisite), ownership fixed, groups retired, approver, date, and
   rollback (remove policy; restore soft-deleted group within 30 days). Log time.

## Guardrails

- Naming and expiration policies need Entra ID P1 for all users and hit every
  group tenant-wide — verify licensing and scope first.
- Fix ownerless groups (two owners minimum) BEFORE enabling expiration, or
  they expire silently.
- Restricting creation without a self-service request path drives shadow IT —
  keep a path.
- Never assume a quiet group is dead; confirm and preserve data before
  retirement. Soft-delete is recoverable for 30 days — say so.
- Keep this policy consistent with teams-governance. Capture prior settings as
  rollback.
