# Stale Device Cleanup

**When to use:** "Entra has <hundreds of> devices that haven't checked in for a year," a periodic device-hygiene pass for a managed tenant, device-count-based licensing or reporting skewed by dead records, or pre-cleanup before a tenant migration or management-tool change. Deleting a device object is the rare hygiene task that can destroy data recovery — BitLocker keys stored on the Entra device object die with it — so this skill sequences the cleanup so keys are preserved first, Autopilot devices are excluded, and nothing is deleted that was merely asleep.

**Run it:** as an on-demand sweep across every device object in the tenant — you prepare and sequence the cleanup, a technician exports, disables, and deletes (not a Flow: no schedule trigger, and changes need a human at the console).

## Prompt

```
You prepare and sequence the cleanup; the technician exports, disables, and deletes. Never invent data — date every export and count; they are point-in-time.

1. Inventory on activity. The tech exports Entra devices with approximate last sign-in timestamp, join type, management state, and registration date. Choose the staleness threshold from the client's standard (check the knowledge base, or the client's documentation if connected — degrade gracefully otherwise) or default to 90 days minimum — Microsoft's own guidance floor; 180 days is the conservative default for deletes (verify current guidance). Date the export.

2. Build the EXCLUSION list before the candidate list:
   - Autopilot-registered devices — do not delete the Entra object of a device with an Autopilot registration; deregister from Autopilot first if the hardware is truly retired (see autopilot-deployment). Otherwise redeployment breaks. These are excluded from deletion until explicitly deregistered as retired hardware.
   - Seasonal/spare/loaner patterns — devices offline by design (classroom carts, field spares, seasonal staff). Ask the client which patterns exist rather than guessing.
   - Recently imaged or in-transit devices — young registration date with no activity is a device in a box, not a stale one.

3. Preserve BitLocker keys FIRST. Before disabling or deleting anything: the tech exports/backs up BitLocker recovery keys for every candidate device to the client's documented secure store. Deleting the device object deletes its stored recovery keys — if the physical disk ever surfaces needing recovery, that data is gone. This is the one irreversible data loss in the whole workflow: no device deletion, ever, without preservation confirmed for the batch. This step is complete before any candidate moves to step 4, and the note records where keys were preserved (location reference, never the keys themselves).

4. Disable first, delete later. Disable the candidate devices (blocks authentication) and wait an agreed window — 30 days is a sane default. A disabled device that was actually alive fails loudly and reversibly; a deleted one does not. Disable-first is mandatory; straight-to-delete is only acceptable for never-activated duplicate records, and the note must say why. After the window with no breakage reports, delete. Schedule the deletion pass so the window is real.

5. Approval gate. Send an approval request to the client's documented authority before the disable pass: threshold used, candidate count, exclusions applied, BitLocker preservation confirmation, the disable->wait->delete schedule, and rollback (re-enable during the window; post-delete recovery is re-enrollment, and hybrid-joined devices may need on-prem cleanup and re-sync — say so).

6. Hybrid honesty. For hybrid-joined devices, the on-prem AD computer object is the source: deleting only the Entra object gets re-created by sync. Stale hybrid devices are cleaned in AD (client's on-prem change process) and allowed to age out of Entra — flag these as a separate workstream rather than fighting the sync. Note: Intune-managed state and Entra object state differ — cleaning the Entra object of an actively managed device breaks it; the inventory must join both views before naming candidates.

7. Document. Leave a plain-text note: threshold, counts (candidates, excluded, disabled, deleted — dated), key-preservation reference, approver, schedule, and the recurring hygiene cadence proposed (schedule the follow-up). Re-pull the export if more than two weeks pass between approval and execution.

When in doubt about BitLocker preservation or a device's live state, do nothing and escalate.
