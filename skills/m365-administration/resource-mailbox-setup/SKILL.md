description: Create and configure room or equipment mailboxes — booking policies, auto-accept vs delegate approval, recurring-meeting and duration limits — so bookings behave the way the client expects. Use when a ticket asks for a bookable meeting room, projector, vehicle, or "why does the room double-book / never respond."

# Resource Mailbox Setup

**When to use:** A ticket asks to set up a calendar for a conference room / pool car / loaner laptop, reports an existing resource misbehaving ("the room accepts everything and double-books" or "booking requests just sit there"), or asks to add delegate approval to an existing room. You ship a resource mailbox whose booking behavior is a deliberate policy, not the defaults.

**Run it:** on one client's request — you confirm the policy and prepare it, a technician drives PowerShell or the admin center (not a Flow: it needs a human at the console).

## Prompt

```
You ship a resource mailbox whose booking behavior is a deliberate policy: who can book, whether a human approves, how far out and how long bookings can run — all confirmed with the client and written down. You prepare and verify; the tech drives PowerShell or the admin center. Never invent data.

1. Confirm type and booking policy with the client before creation — these are the questions the defaults silently answer wrong (read the ticket for context):
   - Room or Equipment? (Rooms get locations in Room Finder; equipment doesn't.)
   - Auto-accept, or delegate approval? Fully automatic is fine for ordinary rooms; anything contended or expensive usually wants a human approver.
   - Who may book: everyone, or a restricted group?
   - Recurring meetings allowed? Standing bookings are how rooms get squatted.
   - Booking window (how far ahead) and maximum duration?

2. Prepare creation for the tech (PowerShell labeled: verify against current module versions):
   - `New-Mailbox -Room -Name "<room>"` or `New-Mailbox -Equipment -Name "<item>"` — no license needed under 50 GB; sign-in on the account stays blocked, same rule as shared mailboxes.

3. Prepare the booking policy via `Set-CalendarProcessing` per the answers:
   - Auto-accept: `-AutomateProcessing AutoAccept` (this is what prevents double-booking — AutoAccept declines conflicts).
   - Delegate approval: `-AllBookInPolicy $false -AllRequestInPolicy $true -ResourceDelegates <approvers>` — requests go to the delegates to accept/decline. Confirm the delegates actually agreed to the job; an approval queue nobody watches is the "requests just sit there" ticket.
   - Restricted booking: `-BookInPolicy <group>` with `-AllBookInPolicy $false` (maintain the group, not a person list).
   - Limits: `-AllowRecurringMeetings`, `-BookingWindowInDays`, `-MaximumDurationInMinutes` per the client's answers.
   - Consider `-AddOrganizerToSubject`/`-DeleteSubject` defaults: hiding subjects protects privacy, showing them helps front-desk staff — ask.
   (Check the client's documentation for documented room/resource standards — skip gracefully if not connected.)

4. For "room misbehaves" tickets, pull the current `Get-CalendarProcessing` output first and diff it against intended behavior — double-booking is almost always `AutomateProcessing` not set to AutoAccept, and silent requests are almost always delegates missing or gone (departed user as sole ResourceDelegate is a classic).

5. Get client sign-off (send an approval request) on the policy summary — booking rules are user-visible behavior for everyone who schedules meetings.

6. Verify via evidence: a test booking auto-accepts (or routes to the delegate), a conflicting booking declines, and an over-limit booking declines with the policy reason. Document what/why/when/rollback — leave a plain-text note: resource name and address, type, full policy (approval mode, who can book, window, duration, recurrence), delegates, approver, date, and rollback (prior CalendarProcessing values captured in step 4, or defaults for new). Log time.

Guardrails: Never leave a contended resource on silent defaults — the booking policy is confirmed with the client, not assumed. Delegate-approval mode requires named, willing delegates; verify they exist and are active before enabling it, and flag single-person approval queues as fragile. Sign-in on resource accounts stays blocked; nobody logs in as the room. Capture prior CalendarProcessing settings before changing an existing resource — that is the rollback. PowerShell labeled: verify against current module versions. When in doubt, do nothing and escalate.
