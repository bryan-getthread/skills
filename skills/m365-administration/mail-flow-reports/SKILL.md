# Mail Flow Reports

**When to use:** A scheduled monthly/quarterly email health review for a client, "how much spam are we actually catching," a baseline capture before/after a filtering change (anti-spam-policy-tuning's verification window), or feeding the email section of a broader review (monthly-security-report owns the security-wide report; this skill owns mail flow depth). Read-only — this skill never changes policy; findings route to the owning skill as recommendations.

## Prompt

```
You are producing a periodic mail flow health summary for a client. Read-only exercise: this skill never changes policy — findings route to the owning skill (anti-spam-policy-tuning, mail-forwarding-audit, email-connector-setup) as recommendations. The agent frames what to pull and reads what the tech pastes back. Never invent numbers; every figure carries its source report and period.

1. Define period and comparison baseline (this month vs last, or vs the same period prior). A number without a baseline is decoration; pull the prior report from the ticket history (search_tickets) or state that this run establishes the baseline. Pull documented client context via search_itglue (skip gracefully if IT Glue isn't connected), search_knowledge_base.

2. Have the tech pull from the EAC / Defender reporting pages (portal names and locations shift — verify current report names against Microsoft's current docs):
   - Mailflow status: total inbound/outbound volume, and the split across good mail / spam / malware / phishing verdicts.
   - Threat protection status: catch counts by detection technology.
   - Top senders and recipients (and top spam recipients — repeat targets are a finding).
   - Connector report: volume per connector, TLS status, delivery failures (feeds email-connector-setup if a connector looks sick).
   - Auto-forwarded messages report (feeds mail-forwarding-audit if new external forwards appeared).
   - Queues / delayed delivery if the period had delivery complaints.
   PowerShell equivalents (`Get-MailTrafficATPReport`, `Get-MailFlowStatusReport` etc.) where the tech prefers export — verify against current module versions; some historical reporting cmdlets have been retired.

3. Compute the readable metrics: total volume and week-over-week trend; spam catch rate (filtered spam / (filtered spam + user-reported misses if tracked)); malware/phish counts; percentage of outbound from connectors vs mailboxes; count of external auto-forwards.

4. Flag anomalies against the baseline — each flag gets a recommended action, not just a highlight:
   - Volume spike (inbound: campaign or attack; outbound: possible compromised account or runaway app — check the top-sender identity; a single mailbox dominating outbound is a security check, not a footnote — treat as a possible compromise indicator and escalate).
   - Catch-rate drop or user-reported-spam rise → anti-spam-policy-tuning review.
   - New top sender that is a device/app → confirm it's a known connector (email-connector-setup), not an abuse path.
   - New external auto-forwards since last period → mail-forwarding-audit.
   - Connector failures/TLS downgrades → investigate before the LOB app owner notices.

5. Output two artifacts: (a) a plain-text ticket note (add_ticket_note) with the metrics table, period comparison, flags and recommended actions, and where each number came from; (b) if the client gets a formatted report, keep the note as the source of record anyway. State any report caps or lookback limits (most portal reports cover ~90 days) rather than presenting a truncated window as the full period — if the portal only shows 90 days, don't report "the quarter" from 90 days minus a week. No client-to-client comparisons in the deliverable; each report stands on its own tenant's data. Log time (log_time_entry).

When in doubt about a security-flavored anomaly, escalate rather than just charting it.
