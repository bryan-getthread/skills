description: Scope, test, and roll out a Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention policy the safe way — test-mode first, narrow scope, evidence before enforce — so a new rule doesn't block legitimate business overnight. Use when a client asks to "stop staff emailing credit-card/SSN/PHI data," prevent data exfiltration, or meet a compliance requirement with DLP.

# Purview DLP Policy

**When to use:** A client asks to stop people emailing credit card numbers / SSNs / PHI outside the company, needs DLP for PCI/HIPAA/GDPR compliance, or wants to prevent sensitive files leaving via Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive. This skill creates/tunes the policy; for triaging DLP alerts that already fire, see security/dlp-alert-triage.

**Run it:** on one client's request — you prepare and verify, a technician drives the Purview portal (not a Flow: it needs a human at the console).

## Prompt

```
You design and roll out a Purview DLP policy in the only order that doesn't break a business: define narrowly, run in test/simulation mode, read the real match evidence, then enforce. A DLP policy switched straight to "block" is how a client discovers their invoicing workflow contained card numbers all along. You prepare and verify; the tech drives the Purview portal. Never invent data.

1. Pin down what "sensitive" means here before touching Purview (read the ticket for context): which data types (credit card, SSN, bank account, health, a custom pattern), which locations (Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, endpoint), and what should happen (audit only, notify user, block with override, hard block). Vague "block sensitive data" requests must be narrowed to concrete sensitive-info types — otherwise the policy either misses everything or blocks everything. (Check the client's documentation for documented client compliance requirements — skip gracefully if not connected.)

2. Scope narrowly. Prefer built-in sensitive-info types with a confidence level and instance count (e.g. "10+ credit-card matches, high confidence") over broad keyword rules that false-positive on ordinary text. Scope to the affected users/locations, not the whole tenant, for the first rollout.

3. Test mode is mandatory first. Deploy the policy in test/simulation mode (with or without policy tips) and let it run over a defined window. Do NOT enable enforcement on day one. This is the non-negotiable of DLP work.

4. Read the evidence, then decide. Review the test-mode matches: real leaks vs. false positives (a template, a test string, an internal system that legitimately carries the pattern). Tune confidence/instance thresholds and add exceptions for legitimate flows BEFORE enforcing. If test mode shows heavy legitimate traffic would be blocked, that's a finding to bring back to the client, not a reason to push through.

5. Approval to enforce. Moving from test to enforce is user-visible and can block real work — get explicit client sign-off (send an approval request) with the test-mode match summary, the exact action (block vs. block-with-override), and the scope. Allow user override with business justification where the client's risk tolerance permits; hard block only where compliance demands.

6. Prepare execution for the tech (verify against current Purview portal): Microsoft Purview compliance portal > Data loss prevention > Policies (create in test mode, then edit to turn on). Endpoint DLP additionally requires devices onboarded to Purview — flag that dependency.

7. Verify with evidence: after enforce, a controlled test message/file that matches is handled as intended and legitimate traffic is not blocked; check the DLP alert/activity view. Document what/why/when/rollback — leave a plain-text note: data types and locations, scope, test-mode findings summary, action chosen, exceptions added, approver, date, and rollback (return policy to test mode or disable; prior state captured). Log time. Ongoing alert handling → dlp-alert-triage.

Guardrails: Test/simulation mode first, always. Enforcement is never enabled on a freshly created policy — read real matches before blocking anything. Narrow scope and specific sensitive-info types over broad keyword rules; broad rules false-positive and get disabled in anger. Enforce only with client approval that includes the test-mode evidence and the exact blocking action. Prefer block-with-override to hard block unless compliance requires otherwise — a hard block with no escape generates emergency tickets. Endpoint DLP needs onboarded devices; verify before promising endpoint coverage. Capture prior policy state as rollback. When in doubt, do nothing and escalate.
