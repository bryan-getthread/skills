# Guest Access Audit

Guest accounts are invited for one project and live forever. This audit
answers three questions with dated evidence: who is in the tenant from
outside, who still needs to be, and what mechanism will keep the answer
current without another manual sweep.

## When to use

- "Audit <client>'s guest users" / "who are these external accounts?"
- Periodic (quarterly/semiannual) guest hygiene for a managed tenant.
- Audit, insurance, or compliance questions about third-party access.
- After offboarding a vendor or ending a partner engagement.

## Steps

1. **Inventory.** Tech exports all users with userType Guest from Entra, with:
   display name, home domain, creation date, invite state (accepted vs
   pending), last sign-in date, and sponsor/inviter if recorded. The agent
   compiles the dated table. Note honestly where data is missing — last
   sign-in is blank for guests who authenticate only into SharePoint sharing
   links, so absence of sign-in is evidence, not proof, of staleness.
2. **Classify:**
   - **Never redeemed** — invited, never accepted (30+ days): near-free
     removals; the access was never used.
   - **Stale** — no sign-in activity past the client's threshold (default
     90 days; use the client's documented standard if one exists in
     search_itglue / search_hudu / search_knowledge_base).
   - **Unknown-purpose** — active but no one can say why: route to the
     client contact for a keep/remove verdict, listing what each guest can
     reach (group and Teams memberships).
   - **Active and sponsored** — keep; record the sponsor.
3. **Check what guests can reach.** Flag guests holding privileged roles
   (critical finding — cross-reference global-admin-audit), guests in
   broad-access groups, and tenant settings that over-permit (guest invite
   settings set to "anyone can invite", guest access to all groups). These are
   findings even if every individual guest is legitimate.
4. **Cleanup with a soft-delete pattern.** For approved removals: disable
   (block sign-in) first, wait an agreed window (e.g., 14–30 days) for
   breakage reports — a guest wired into a Teams workflow or shared library
   breaks visibly — then delete. Removing a guest removes their access to
   Teams, shared files, and apps at once; say so in the approval.
5. **Approval gate.** send_approval to the client's documented authority with
   the removal list (name + home domain + last activity + what they lose),
   the disable-then-delete schedule, and the rollback (re-enable during the
   wait window; re-invite after deletion loses prior permissions — that part
   is one-way).
6. **Make it self-maintaining.** Propose Entra access reviews for guests
   (requires Entra ID P2/Governance licensing — state the dependency; if
   unlicensed, schedule the manual re-audit instead via schedule_ticket) with
   auto-removal on non-response, and sensible invite-restriction settings.
7. **Document.** Plain-text note: counts per class (dated, labeled as
   point-in-time), actions taken with approver, the recurring mechanism now
   in place, and follow-up tickets created for tenant-setting findings.

## Guardrails

- No guest deletion without approval and the disable-first wait window;
  deletion severs sharing links and Teams membership irreversibly.
- Blank sign-in data is not a staleness verdict on its own — corroborate
  (creation date, group memberships, sponsor check) before listing a guest
  for removal.
- A guest with a privileged role is an immediate escalation, not a cleanup
  line item.
- Counts and activity windows are point-in-time console exports — date them
  and label them as such; do not present the inventory as continuously true.
- Full guest lists with names and domains go in the client's documentation
  system, not in PSA-synced notes — the note carries counts and the storage
  reference.
