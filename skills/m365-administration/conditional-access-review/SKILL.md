# Conditional Access Review

**When to use:** A scheduled/periodic CA review for a managed tenant (quarterly is typical), "are <client>'s conditional access policies any good?" / insurance or audit prep, after an identity incident to find why CA didn't stop it, or before consolidating or migrating policies (e.g., off security defaults — see the security-defaults-vs-ca skill). CA policy sets rot in a specific way: exceptions accumulate, new apps arrive unprotected, and two policies quietly fight. This review inventories what the policies actually do today, finds the gaps, and enforces the report-only discipline for anything that changes.

## Prompt

```
You are preparing a Conditional Access review for a technician to execute. The tech exports policies and runs changes; you compile the inventory, rank findings, and build remediation tickets. This review changes nothing by itself — it produces findings and remediation tickets, each carrying its own approval and report-only cycle. Never mark a policy as changed on intention, and never invent policy contents or sign-in counts.

1. Inventory. Tech exports every CA policy (including disabled and report-only). For each, record: state, users/groups in and excluded, apps covered, conditions (locations, platforms, client apps, risk), grant/session controls, and last-modified date. The agent compiles this into a single dated table — this is the review artifact. search_itglue / search_hudu / search_knowledge_base for the client's documented CA standard (skip gracefully if absent).

2. Check the non-negotiables first:
   - Legacy authentication blocked for all users (the single highest-value policy; verify with sign-in logs filtered to legacy client apps — if legacy auth still has real traffic, blocking it needs its own remediation ticket, not a silent enable).
   - MFA required for all users, and phishing-resistant or at minimum MFA on every administrator role.
   - Break-glass accounts excluded from every policy — cross-check against the break-glass-account-audit skill; missing exclusions are a critical finding in both directions (no exclusion = lockout risk; excluded daily-driver accounts = bypass risk). Verify break-glass exclusions before ANY policy enablement from this review.

3. Find the rot:
   - Stale exceptions: every excluded user/group/app must have a written justification and expiry (see conditional-access-exception). Exclusions nobody can explain are findings.
   - Overlaps and conflicts: policies targeting the same users/apps with different grants — determine the effective result (block wins; grants combine) and flag pairs whose combined effect nobody intended.
   - Coverage gaps: apps or user populations no policy touches ("All apps" vs named-app policies), new admin roles not in the admin policy, guest users unhandled.
   - Report-only orphans: policies parked in report-only for months — either graduate them or delete them; they are decisions nobody made.

4. Rank findings worst-first (critical: no legacy-auth block, admins without MFA, break-glass problems; high: unjustified exclusions, coverage gaps on sensitive apps; medium: overlaps, naming/hygiene) with a concrete remediation for each. Sign-in-log evidence is point-in-time and may be capped — state the window and label counts as observed-in-window, not absolutes.

5. Report-only discipline for every change. Any new or modified policy from this review: create in report-only → let it accumulate real sign-in data (days, not minutes) → tech reviews the report-only results for would-have-blocked legitimate traffic → only then enable, with client approval (send_approval) for anything that can block users. What-if tool spot checks supplement, never replace, report-only data. Never enable a blocking policy the same day it was written; when in doubt, leave it in report-only and say so.

6. Output. Document via a plain-text note (add_ticket_note) — the dated review (or client-facing summary if requested): inventory table, findings ranked with evidence, remediation list. Create follow-up tickets (create_ticket) for remediations rather than burying them in the note, and schedule the next periodic review (schedule_ticket). Do not paste tenant identifiers, full policy JSON exports, or user lists into notes destined for PSA sync — summarize, and store the export in the client's documentation system (IT Glue/Hudu).

When in doubt about a policy's effect or whether a change is safe to enable, do nothing, leave it in report-only, and say so.
