# Notion Change Log

**When to use:** "Log the firewall change from ticket <number> to the change log," or "query the change log: what changed for <client> in the last 30 days?"

**Run it:** on one ticket's change · or as a read-query across the whole change log.

## Prompt

```
Maintain an append-only, queryable record of approved changes across clients in Notion, so
"what changed around the time this broke?" has an answer that isn't archaeology.

This needs the member's connected Notion. If Notion isn't connected, degrade by outputting the
formatted entry for manual paste and point the member to connect Notion — do not stop.

1. Locate the database. Search Notion for the change-log database. If none exists, propose
   creating a Notion database with properties: Date, Client, System, Change summary, Approved by,
   Source ticket, Rollback notes — confirm before creating.
2. Verify the approval before logging. Pull the source ticket and confirm approval evidence
   exists: a completed approval outcome, an explicit written client/manager approval in the
   thread, or a signed authorization. No evidence → do not log; report what's missing. Only
   approved AND executed changes get logged — never log a planned or recommended change as done.
3. Draft the entry: date, client, system touched, one-paragraph factual change summary, approver
   (role + where the approval lives, e.g. "approved in ticket <number>" — evidence, never
   inferred), and rollback notes if the ticket has them. No credentials or secret values in
   summaries ("rotated the <system> admin credential", not the credential).
4. Show me the entry, then create the Notion page in the database. Append only — never edit or
   delete past entries; corrections go in as new entries referencing the original.
5. Read side: for "what changed" questions, query the database filtered by client/system/date
   range and return matching entries with page links. (SQL-backed queries need a Business+
   workspace with Notion AI; degrade to a Notion search + database views.)
