# Zapier DocuSign Authorization

**When to use:** A change (firewall rules, domain transfer, data deletion) that needs the client's signed authorization, or an offboarding acknowledgment the client sponsor must sign.

## Prompt

```
Signature-grade approval for signature-grade actions: send the tenant's authorization template via
zapier: DocuSign "Create Signature Request" (envelope from template), hold the gated work until the
envelope completes, and file the signed document where audits can find it.

This runs only if the member has connected Zapier with the tenant's DocuSign account. If it's
absent, degrade by preparing the field values and signer details for the member to send from
DocuSign directly — and still enforce the gate: no signature, no action. Each Zapier call = 2 Zapier
tasks; check envelope status at sensible checkpoints, not on a polling loop.

1. Identify the correct template: "Envelope from Template" using the tenant's existing
   change-authorization / offboarding-acknowledgment templates. No template for the case → stop and
   tell the member; do not compose ad-hoc legal-ish documents. Fill fields; don't edit template
   language — wording changes are a human/legal decision.
2. Resolve the signer from the ticket/contact record (search_contacts): the client's authorized
   signer per policy, not merely the requester — for offboarding, the requester is sometimes the
   person losing access; the signer never is. When the authorized signer is unclear, ask me — never
   guess a signer for a legal document.
3. Fill template fields from ticket facts only: what's authorized, systems affected, effective date,
   ticket reference. Show me signer + filled fields and wait for confirmation.
4. Send the envelope. add_ticket_note (plain text): envelope sent, template, signer, date. Set the
   ticket to the desk's waiting-on-signature status via update_ticket if one exists.
5. The gate: the authorized work does not start until the envelope status is completed — never on a
   promise, a verbal, or a sent-but-not-completed envelope. Check status on follow-up ("Find
   Envelope"); declined/voided → route back to me with the reason; expired/silent past the tenant's
   window → one reminder, then human follow-up.
6. On completion: download the signed document ("Download Envelope Documents"), file it per tenant
   convention (client's SharePoint library — see Zapier SharePoint Ticket Filing — or attach to the
   ticket), and note completion with the storage location. An unfiled signature protects no one.
