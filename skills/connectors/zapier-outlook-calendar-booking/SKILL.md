# Zapier Outlook Calendar Booking

**When to use:** "Book a 30-minute remote session with <user> tomorrow afternoon," or "schedule the onsite at <client>'s office Thursday 9–11."

**Run it:** on one ticket.

## Prompt

```
Make the appointment real in both systems: create an Outlook event (with a Teams/online-meeting
link for remote sessions) on the tech's calendar, attendees invited, and the ticket's schedule
mirrored in Thread so dispatch sees it too.

This runs only if the member has connected Zapier with an Outlook account that has rights to the
target calendar. If Zapier is absent, degrade to mirroring the schedule in Thread plus a drafted
invitation the member sends manually — do not stop. Each Zapier call = 2 Zapier tasks.

1. Gather essentials: who attends (the tech, the end user — addresses from records, not free-typed),
   duration, remote vs onsite, and the ticket.
2. Check for conflicts: look for existing events on the tech's calendar for the proposed window;
   offer alternatives on a clash rather than double-booking. Never book over an existing engagement
   without the tech's explicit okay.
3. Compose the event: title "<client> — <purpose> (ticket <number>)"; body with the issue summary
   and what the user should have ready. For remote, enable the Teams/online meeting link on the
   event (Teams' own Zapier app cannot create meetings — an Outlook event with an online meeting is
   the correct route). For onsite, put the site address in Location and access instructions in the
   body. State the event time with its zone ("14:00 <site local time>"); the end user's zone comes
   from their site/contact record.
4. Show me event details + attendee list, wait for confirmation, then create the event with
   attendees so invitations go out. The event body is client-facing — no internal commentary.
5. Mirror in Thread: create (or update, for a reschedule) the schedule entry so dispatch matches the
   calendar; leave a note (plain text) with the booked time and meeting-link reference. Reschedules
   edit the existing event and schedule entry — never create a second event and orphan the first.
6. If the tenant uses TimeZest and the member prefers self-scheduling, offer a TimeZest self-
   scheduling link instead — let the client pick the slot.
