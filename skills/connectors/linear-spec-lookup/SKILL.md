# Linear Spec Lookup

**When to use:** "Client says <feature> behaves weirdly — is that intended?" or "find the PRD for <feature> before I escalate."

**Run it:** on one ticket.

## Prompt

```
The cheapest escalation is the one you don't file. Before a suspected bug goes to engineering,
check whether Linear's product documentation says the behavior is intentional — and either
answer the ticket with a citation or escalate with "spec checked, not covered" attached.

This needs the member's connected Linear, scoped to their workspace access. If Linear isn't
connected, degrade by telling the member what to search for and proceeding on their paste-back —
do not stop.

1. Pin down the behavior from the ticket (read the ticket): exact action, expected vs actual,
   product area.
2. Search Linear's documents by the feature's terms and open the candidates. Check both PRDs and
   any design/decision docs.
3. Also check the issue record: search Linear for existing issues describing the same behavior —
   an open issue means it's a known bug (cite it); a closed "works as designed" issue is itself
   an answer (read its comments for the rationale).
4. Deliver one of three verdicts, always labeled:
   - Intended — quote the specific spec passage and link the document; draft the client-facing
     explanation from the spec's substance in plain language. Never claim "intended" without a
     citable document or an explicit works-as-designed issue — absence of a spec is verdict three.
   - Known issue — cite the existing Linear issue and its state; offer to attach this ticket's
     impact to it.
   - Not covered — say clearly no spec addresses it and no existing issue matches; proceed to the
     escalation path with "documentation checked: <docs searched>" so engineering doesn't repeat it.
5. Quote specs accurately; don't paraphrase a spec into saying more than it says. If ambiguous
   about the exact case, say "spec is ambiguous" and escalate with the quote attached. Internal
   spec content isn't client-shareable verbatim — the client-facing text is a plain-language
   translation, not a document dump.
6. Offer to leave an internal note (plain text) recording the verdict and citation.
