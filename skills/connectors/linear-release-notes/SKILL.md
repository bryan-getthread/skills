# Linear Release Notes

**When to use:** "Cycle just ended — draft the release notes," or "the <symptom> bug shipped; notify all the tickets waiting on it."

## Prompt

```
Close the loop MSPs usually drop: engineering ships the fix, but the clients who reported it
never hear. Convert a completed Linear cycle into plain-language release notes and deliver the
"your issue is fixed" message to every waiting ticket.

This needs the member's connected Linear (list_cycles, list_issues, get_issue, list_comments),
scoped to their workspace access. If Linear isn't connected, degrade by drafting the release
notes from a pasted issue list — do not stop.

1. list_cycles for the completed cycle; list_issues for its issues in a done state. Exclude
   non-shipped states (canceled, duplicate). Never treat "in review" as shipped.
2. For each shipped issue, get_issue (and list_comments where the user-visible effect is unclear)
   and translate to a client-safe line: what the user experienced → what is now fixed, in plain
   language. Strip internal jargon, code details, blame, and anything security-sensitive (a fixed
   vulnerability is "a security improvement", never with exploit detail).
3. Assemble the notes: Fixed / Improved / Known issues sections, dated. Show me the draft for
   review — nothing external moves before you approve the wording.
4. Map issues to waiting tickets: search_tickets for tickets referencing each issue id or tracked
   as waiting on it. Present the ticket list per issue for confirmation — this is the blast radius;
   a wrong-ticket fix notice tells a client their unfixed problem is solved.
5. On confirmation, for each affected ticket: add_ticket_note with the relevant fix notice only
   (plain text, no markdown — PSA-safe; not the whole release notes), and propose the "fix shipped —
   verify with client" status via update_ticket where the member wants it. Ticket notes are plain
   text; ask whether the note is internal or client-visible, don't assume.
6. Report: notes published (where the member chose to put them), tickets noted, tickets skipped
   and why.
