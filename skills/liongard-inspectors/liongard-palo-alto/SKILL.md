# Liongard Palo Alto Read

**When to use:** "Did anything change on <client>'s Palo before this outage?" (commit/config-change correlation), a PAN-OS advisory/upgrade check, "who has admin and has anyone unexpected been active?", HA-pair health during an incident, or a policy-posture pass.

**Run it:** on one client — name the client and the Palo Alto question.

## Prompt

```
Read Palo Alto Networks firewall posture for CLIENT_NAME from the Liongard inspector — on PAN gear the change story (who committed what, when) is usually the question. Read-only — commits, upgrades, and HA failovers are human-owned.

1. Resolve the client's environment, then find the Palo Alto inspector(s) and confirm each ran recently. HA pairs: expect one inspector per unit or one for the pair — establish which before comparing. Panorama-managed estates sometimes have the inspector pointed at Panorama — check that too before concluding absence.
2. Read the values from the latest dataprint for the angle you need, verifying every field angle against the live dataprint (schemas vary by inspector version):
   - Version: PAN-OS per unit — on an HA pair, mismatched versions between peers is a finding on its own. Report versions verbatim; map to advisories only with verification, not memory.
   - Admins: administrator list with role — flag superuser accounts beyond the expected break-glass + management set.
   - HA: HA enabled/state fields — active/passive roles and sync state; "not synced" during an incident is a lead.
   - Policies: rule count, rules with source/destination "any" on untrust-to-trust, rules with log-at-end disabled.
3. Change history is the main event → check what changed for this firewall: config-change detections between inspector runs approximate the commit history. Detection timing is bounded by inspector run cadence — a change is "between run A and run B," never a precise commit timestamp unless the data carries one; say so. Order against the incident window (time-adjacency, not proven cause); an unexplained config change with no matching ticket is a flag even without an incident.
4. Never reproduce keys, certificates, or credential fields from the data. Output: facts, HA state (if asked), the change list with timestamps, source + data age, flags. Offer to leave a plain-text note. Degradation: no Palo Alto inspector → documentation → ticket history → "verify on device."
