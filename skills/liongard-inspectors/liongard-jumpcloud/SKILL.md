# Liongard JumpCloud Read

**When to use:** "Who has an account in <client>'s JumpCloud?" for an access review or offboarding, "which users don't have MFA enrolled?", "who has admin?", or "what devices/systems are bound?".

**Run it:** on one client — name the client and the JumpCloud question.

## Prompt

```
Answer a JumpCloud directory question for CLIENT_NAME from the Liongard JumpCloud inspector. Read-only — disabling users, changing MFA, or editing groups is a technician's job; never convert a finding into a completed action.

1. Resolve the client's environment, then find the JumpCloud inspector and confirm it ran recently — every answer carries "as of <timestamp>."
2. Read the values from its latest dataprint for the angle you need, verifying every field angle against the live dataprint (schemas vary by inspector version):
   - Users: user list with status and MFA flag — count users without MFA.
   - Admins: admin accounts with role — count and name for review.
   - Groups: group membership for a named user (offboarding).
   - Devices: bound systems with last-seen.
3. "What changed?" → check what changed on the JumpCloud side: user adds/removes, admin/group changes, MFA-state shifts — ordered against the incident window.
4. Sanity-check surprising zeros (no users, no admins) — usually a wrong field angle or partial inspection; re-probe broadly. Absence of a user in JumpCloud is not proof they have no access elsewhere — cross-check other IdPs (Okta/Entra/Duo) before asserting.
5. Access findings are review inputs, not accusations — "unrecognized admin, verify" phrasing. Output: a compact table, source + data age line, and flags (users without MFA, excess admins, stale/enabled ex-employee accounts). Offer to leave a plain-text note. If no JumpCloud inspector exists, degrade: documentation → ticket history → "verify in console."
