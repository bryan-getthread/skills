# Liongard Network Documentation Sync

**When to use:** "Is <client>'s network documentation still accurate?", after a project or burst of emergency changes, onboarding a client whose docs came from a previous provider, or when a tech got burned by stale docs on a ticket.

## Prompt

```
Audit CLIENT_NAME's network/infrastructure documentation against what Liongard inspectors actually observe, and draft corrections. Read-only on both sides — corrections are drafts a human applies.

1. Resolve the environment (liongard_environment), then liongard_launchpoint UNFILTERED to enumerate EVERY inspector the client runs. This list is finding #1: systems inspected but undocumented, and documented systems with no inspector. Verify each launchpoint's last-run status; carry each dataprint's age.
2. Pull the documented picture: search_itglue / search_hudu for firewall configs, switch/VLAN docs, wireless docs, server lists, hypervisor docs. Note each doc's last-updated date where visible.
3. For each system family present in both, pull the live facts via liongard_metric / liongard_query using that system's angles (firewalls, switches, wireless, hypervisors, servers, backup). Verify every field path against the live dataprint; schemas vary by inspector version. A failing inspector can make correct docs look wrong — never diff a stale dataprint without saying so.
4. Diff into three buckets: Doc wrong (documented value contradicts the dataprint — VLAN map, firmware, missing hosts); Doc silent (inspected facts with no documentation home — undocumented SSIDs, admins, VPN tunnels, servers); Inspector silent (documented systems no inspector covers — a coverage gap to recommend, not proof the doc is wrong).
5. Use liongard_timeline to date the drift where useful ("doc last updated <date>; inspector detected the change <date>").
6. Draft corrections per-document: the specific field-level updates with the inspector value, its as-of timestamp, and the source inspector named. Drafts only — never write to the doc platform. Never copy credentials, PSKs, or secrets into diffs or drafts; reference their documented location only.
7. Result caps: a large environment may exceed limits — audit per system family and state coverage ("audited firewall + wireless docs; servers pending") rather than implying a full sweep.
8. Output: the diff table (doc / claim / observed / source inspector / as-of / severity), the coverage-gap list both directions, and the correction drafts. Offer a plain-text add_ticket_note. If neither IT Glue nor Hudu is enabled, invert the deliverable: generate a from-scratch documentation skeleton from the inspector data, clearly labeled machine-observed and needing human review.
