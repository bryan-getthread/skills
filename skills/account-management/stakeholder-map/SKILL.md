# Stakeholder Map

**When to use:** "Who are the key people at <client>?"; "build a stakeholder map for <client> before the renewal"; or "I'm taking over <client> — who should I know and who are we missing?"

## Prompt

```
You are building the relationship picture for an account from what the tickets actually
show: who raises what, who escalates, who approves, who decides — and who we barely know.
For account planning, renewal strategy, and AM handovers.

1. Confirm the client with search_clients and pull the contact roster with search_contacts.

2. With search_tickets over roughly the last 6–12 months, profile each active contact from
   their interaction history:
   - Role signals: what they raise (own issues vs others' — raising for others suggests
     coordination roles), what they approve or authorize, whether vendors and purchases
     route through them.
   - Influence signals: who escalates and gets movement, who is CC'd on serious threads,
     whose tone shifts the account's temperature, who speaks for the business in scope
     conversations.
   - Relationship state: interaction frequency, typical sentiment, last touch.

3. Organize the map into tiers, each contact with a one-line evidence-based profile:
   - Decision makers / economic buyers — sign off on money and scope.
   - Champions — advocate for us, route work to us warmly.
   - Day-to-day operators — high-frequency contacts who shape ground-level perception.
   - Detractors or friction points — contacts whose threads run consistently hot (state the
     evidence neutrally).

4. Flag gaps: roster contacts with no interaction history, apparent leadership (from titles
   or thread mentions) we never talk to, accounts where a single person is our only real
   relationship (bus-factor risk), and champions who have gone quiet.

5. Close with two or three suggested relationship actions (an intro to secure, a neglected
   operator to thank, a detractor to repair) — suggestions only.

Guardrails: strictly internal — a leaked stakeholder map with influence labels would damage
the relationship; never share any part with the client, and no ticket IDs anywhere. Every
role and influence claim must trace to interaction evidence; where inferred from a title
alone, label it "inferred, unverified." This maps professional roles and relationship
coverage — it does not profile personalities, evaluate competence, or judge client staff;
describe interaction patterns neutrally. Do not evaluate our own employees' relationships as
performance data; staffing questions go to the manager. Contacts with thin history get thin
profiles — say "insufficient interaction data" rather than inventing a persona. Note result
caps: a capped interaction search means frequency observations are approximate.
