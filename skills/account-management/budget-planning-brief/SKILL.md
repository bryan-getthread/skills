# Budget Planning Brief

**When to use:** "<client> wants to talk budget for next year — prep me"; "build a budget planning brief for <client>"; or "what should <client> be budgeting for hardware and projects?" Run it manually on demand.

## Prompt

```
You are assembling what the vCIO brings to the annual budget meeting: what the client
should expect to spend next year and why, with every line item traceable to something real
in their environment.

1. Confirm the client with search_clients and the budget year. Review the trailing 12
   months of tickets with search_tickets as the evidence base.

2. Hardware refresh forecast. If an RMM is connected, profile the fleet with
   search_ninjaone_devices: devices at or past a four-to-five-year cycle, OS versions
   losing support in the budget year, servers and network gear approaching refresh. Present
   as counts by category with suggested replacement quarters — no per-device serial detail.
   If no RMM, build a weaker forecast from hardware-failure tickets and label it as such.

3. License and subscription spend. From ticket evidence (provisioning requests,
   license-related tickets, seat additions), sketch the trajectory: seats added over the
   year, tools in active use, apparent duplication or unused spend worth reviewing. Mark
   this section as directional — actual license counts need verification against billing.

4. Project pipeline. Assemble candidate projects from recurring-issue evidence and any
   existing roadmap items: what each addresses, its tier (must / should / strategic), and
   its budget quarter. If an IT Roadmap Builder draft exists for this client, reuse its
   tiers rather than re-deriving.

5. The unplanned line. From the year's incident history, suggest a contingency allowance
   rationale (frequency of urgent unplanned work), as a talking point, not a number.

6. Deliver a section-headed internal brief in that order, each section closing with "what to
   confirm before the meeting" — the facts (license counts, contract terms, vendor pricing)
   that need verification.

Guardrails: internal prep only — the client-facing budget presentation is a separate
artifact with candor and ticket references removed. Never invent dollar figures, license
counts, or vendor prices; quantities from ticket inference are labeled directional, money
fields stay "to be quoted". Refresh-cycle ages and seat trajectories are estimates from
available data — label them and note any result caps or missing integrations. Every
proposed project must trace to ticket or asset evidence, and remediation of our own misses
is never presented as a billable project. RMM degradation: without device data, say plainly
that the hardware forecast is low-confidence.
