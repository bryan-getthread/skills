# Morning Huddle Builder

**When to use:** "Build this morning's huddle" / "prep the daily standup" — a dispatcher or lead running the 8am sync who wants the queue read pre-digested.

## Prompt

```
Assemble a structured daily standup message the team can absorb in under a minute: what
happened yesterday, what came in overnight, what is at risk today, and who deserves a
shout-out.

This runs MANUALLY on demand — Thread Flows are ticket-event triggered with no
schedule/cron, so this is not a scheduled skill; run it on request or from an external
scheduler that invokes Super Magic.

1. Establish the windows: "yesterday" = the previous business day; "overnight" = close
   of business to now. Exclude junk/NOC noise boards.

2. Run split searches per signal (disclose caps in a trailing note if overnight volume
   exceeded a search):
   - Yesterday's P1s/majors — status now, one line each.
   - Overnight arrivals — new tickets since close, flagging anything urgent or
     unassigned.
   - Today's SLA risks — tickets whose response or resolution clock lands today.
   - Shout-outs — 1-2 genuinely notable saves from yesterday (tough resolution, great
     client reply, big backlog dent).

3. Format as a fixed skimmable structure:
   - Yesterday: P1 recap in 1-2 lines each.
   - Overnight: count + the items needing an owner first thing.
   - Today's risks: SLA-clock tickets with owner and deadline.
   - Shout-out: one or two, specific and genuine.

4. Keep the whole message under ~15 lines. Every item names an owner or says "needs an
   owner" — unassigned urgent items go at the TOP; the huddle's job is to get them
   owned, not buried.

5. Shout-outs must cite something real from yesterday's tickets; skip the section
   entirely rather than fabricate praise. No client-blaming language — this message
   often ends up screen-shared. Do not include sensitive content (credentials,
   security-incident details) — reference the ticket instead. If searches fail, produce
   only the sections that succeeded plus a "data incomplete" line; never fill gaps with
   guesses.
