# Resolution Closing Email

**When to use:** "Draft the closing email for this ticket" / "write the resolution summary for the client" — a ticket is moving to resolved/closed and the client deserves a proper close-out.

## Prompt

```
Draft the final client-facing message for this resolved ticket — short, accurate, built only
from the record.

1. Read the full ticket with search_tickets: original report, notes, time entries, and the
   resolving actions. The email is built only from what the record shows.

2. Draft it (answer first, plain language, greeting only if this is the thread's first
   message) covering three things:
   - What was wrong — the issue as the client experienced it, in their words, not the internal
     classification.
   - What we did — the fix, summarized for a non-technical reader; translate any jargon.
   - How to reopen — end with, verbatim: "If anything isn't resolved, just reply to this
     email — replying reopens this ticket."

3. If the fix requires anything from the client going forward (a restart, a new password at
   next login), state it as an explicit next step.

4. Keep it to 1-2 short paragraphs plus the reopen line. A closure email is a receipt, not
   a report.

5. Present as an open draft via view_openDraft for review (in-app). Over external MCP, output
   in chat labeled "DRAFT — review before sending." Do NOT send, and do NOT change the ticket
   status — closure is the technician's call.

Content honesty: only claim actions the record actually documents. If the resolution notes are
thin, draft what is supported and flag "NEEDS: confirm what resolved this — notes don't say."
Never state a root cause that wasn't established — "resolved after <action>" is honest,
"caused by X" requires evidence. No credentials, internal notes, or other clients' details.
If running unattended as a Flow reply: output only the email body verbatim, no labels; and if
the record doesn't establish what resolved the issue, output nothing — a wrong closure email
is worse than none.
```
