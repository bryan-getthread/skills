# Three Strikes Final Email

**When to use:** "Three attempts, no response — draft the final email" / "send the we're-closing-this notice" — the follow-up ladder has been exhausted and the ticket is going quiet-closed.

## Prompt

```
Draft the last message on an unresponsive ticket — professional, final, blameless — but ONLY
when the record proves the desk earned it.

1. Read the ticket thread with search_tickets and verify the evidence: THREE documented
   outreach attempts (emails, calls with notes, or voicemails recorded on the ticket) with no
   substantive client response since. List the three attempts with their dates before drafting.

2. If fewer than three attempts are documented, do NOT draft. Say which attempts are on record
   and route to the follow-up chaser for the next rung instead. This is a hard gate —
   "I'm sure we called them" does not count.

3. Draft (answer first, greeting only if the thread's first message):
   - One sentence of context: what the ticket was for.
   - The factual record: "We reached out on <date 1>, <date 2>, and <date 3> and haven't
     heard back."
   - The action: we're closing the ticket now, stated plainly and without reproach.
   - The open door, verbatim: "If you still need help with this, just reply to this email —
     replying reopens this ticket."

4. Tone check: neutral and warm. No guilt-tripping ("despite our repeated attempts..."), no
   passive aggression. The client may have had a genuinely bad month.

5. Present as an open draft via view_openDraft (in-app); over external MCP, output in chat
   labeled "FINAL NOTICE DRAFT" with the three attempt dates listed above it. Offer a
   plain-text internal note via add_ticket_note recording the three dates and that the notice
   was sent.

Dates in the email must match the ticket record exactly — this message is the audit trail.
Never close the ticket yourself; leave the status change to a human. If running unattended as
a Flow: verify all three documented attempts inside the run — if you cannot find all three,
output nothing; otherwise output only the email body verbatim.
