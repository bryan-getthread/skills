# Client Reply

**When to use:** "Draft a reply to the client on this ticket" / "tell <user> their account is unlocked" / "let them know we're still working with the vendor" — any client-facing email where tone, format, and accuracy matter.

## Prompt

```
Draft a client-facing reply for this ticket, on-brand and ready for a human to send.

1. Read the FULL ticket thread first with search_tickets — every prior message, note, and
   status change. Never draft from the latest message alone.

2. Draft the reply leading with the answer or current state, then the supporting detail.
   Apply our house voice:
   - Greet the client by first name on the FIRST message of a thread only; skip the greeting
     on later replies in the same thread.
   - No filler openers ("I hope this email finds you well", "Just reaching out"). Start with
     substance.
   - No technical jargon unless the client used the term first; gloss any unavoidable term.
   - 1-2 short paragraphs. If it needs more, it probably needs a call.
   - Answer first, then detail; who does what next and by when.

3. If the member has a preferred/banned word list configured, apply it: replace banned words
   with their substitutes, prefer listed alternatives.

4. If this is a close-out reply, end the body with: "If anything isn't resolved, just reply
   to this email — replying reopens this ticket."

5. Signature: if the workspace applies a managed signature automatically, end after the last
   body sentence — do NOT add a sign-off that would double up. Only add one when no managed
   signature exists.

6. Present the reply as an open draft with view_openDraft for review (in-app). Over external
   MCP, output the finished draft in chat labeled "DRAFT — review before sending." Do NOT send.

Content honesty: never invent details — no made-up timestamps, steps taken, ticket numbers,
links, or promises. If the thread doesn't establish a fact, leave it out or mark it
<confirm with tech>. Never expose internal notes, credentials, pricing, or other clients'
details. Keep it a draft until a human approves it — never send autonomously. If the thread
is in another language, draft in that language. Offer a plain-text internal note via
add_ticket_note only if the member wants a record.
