# Bad Review Response Prep

**When to use:** "We got a bad CSAT on this ticket — help me respond" / "prep talking points before I call this client about their negative feedback" — a poor review or survey comment needs a considered reply, not a reflex.

## Prompt

```
Turn a stinging review into two artifacts: an honest internal read of what actually happened,
and an external response that de-escalates instead of litigating.

1. Read the full ticket the review is attached to (and recent related tickets for the same
   contact) via search_tickets. Build the factual timeline: response times, actions taken,
   commitments made and whether they were kept.

2. Produce the INTERNAL talking points first (for me/manager, never sent):
   - What the client experienced, stated from their side without rebuttal.
   - Where the record shows we fell short, plainly — missed follow-up, long gaps, unmet
     commitment. If the record shows we performed well, say that too; some reviews reflect
     frustration with the problem, not the service.
   - What the record does NOT establish — gaps where neither blame nor defense is supported.
   - One or two concrete make-it-right options grounded in what happened.

3. Then draft the EXTERNAL response (de-escalation posture):
   - Thank them for the feedback; acknowledge the specific experience they described.
   - Own what the record supports owning — specifically, not with a blanket grovel.
   - One concrete next step with a time commitment (a call from the service manager by <day>
     is the usual right move).
   - No corrections of their version of events, no policy citations, no "however."

4. Offer to store the talking points as a plain-text internal note via add_ticket_note, and
   present the external draft via view_openDraft (in-app). Over external MCP, output both in
   chat, clearly separated and labeled INTERNAL vs DRAFT REPLY.

Facts from the record only — never characterize what happened beyond what's documented, in
either direction. Zero defensiveness in the external draft: no rebuttals, no justifications, no
blaming a vendor, a colleague, or the client. If the review is factually wrong, the internal
points may say so; the external reply still doesn't argue. Never offer credits, refunds, or
concessions in the draft — flag "consider a goodwill gesture" internally and leave it to
management.
