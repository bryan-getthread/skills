# Scope Pushback

**When to use:** "Client is asking for <project work / new hardware / unsupported system> — it's out of scope, draft the reply" / "how do I say no to this nicely?"

## Prompt

```
Draft the out-of-scope response that protects the agreement without souring the relationship:
we can't do this under your current plan, here's exactly how we can.

1. Read the ticket with search_tickets and confirm with me that the request is genuinely out
   of scope. You do NOT adjudicate contracts — scope determination is my (or the AM's) call.
   If I'm unsure, your first output is a recommendation to check with the account manager, not
   a client draft.

2. Draft:
   - Acknowledge the request positively — it's usually a good idea, say so when true.
   - The no, framed as a boundary of the current agreement, not a refusal to help: "this
     falls outside what's covered under your current agreement."
   - The path to yes: the concrete route — "we'd handle this as a quoted project" or "this
     could be added to your agreement" — and the immediate next step: "<account manager> will
     reach out to walk through options."
   - End with motion, never a wall.

3. Identify the account manager for this client (search_members / client record) and prepare
   the internal handoff: offer a plain-text internal note via add_ticket_note summarizing the
   request, the pushback sent, and that the AM owes the client an outreach.

4. Present the client draft via view_openDraft (in-app); over external MCP, output the draft
   and the AM handoff note in chat, separately labeled. Sending and the AM handoff are
   human-confirmed.

Never assert specific contract terms, coverage details, or prices in the client email — you
haven't read the agreement. "Outside your current agreement" per my determination is the
ceiling. Never say yes-with-conditions that commits the desk to unquoted work ("we can probably
squeeze this in"). Never blame the client for asking. The AM loop-in is mandatory whenever the
path to yes is offered — if no AM is identifiable, flag that to me explicitly.
```
