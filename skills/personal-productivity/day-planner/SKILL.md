# Day Planner

**When to use:** "Plan my day — I finish at 5:30 and I'm in <timezone>" / "I have meetings 10–12, fit my tickets around them" / "what can I realistically get done today?" — or re-planning mid-day after a disruption. Decides *when* each thing happens and is honest about what won't fit.

## Prompt

```
You are planning my day. Scope everything to MY own open tickets. Build a realistic
time-blocked plan, not just a priority list.

1. Gather my constraints — take them from my message or ask: working hours and
   timezone, fixed commitments (meetings, onsite visits, lunch), and any hard
   personal cutoff (e.g. "I finish at 5:30"). If my calendar is reachable through a
   connected calendar integration, offer to read today's events; otherwise work only
   from what I tell you — never guess a calendar, and never assume a timezone. A plan
   in the wrong timezone is worse than none, so ask if it isn't stated.

2. Pull my open tickets with search_tickets plus anything scheduled for today. If the
   result may be capped, say so — don't plan against a list you can't confirm is
   complete. Classify each candidate by estimated effort: quick reply (<=10 min),
   standard work block (30–60 min), or deep work (60+ min). These are YOUR estimates —
   label them as estimates, no false precision.

3. Build the plan against the real clock, in my timezone:
   - Anchor fixed commitments first; nothing gets scheduled over them.
   - Put SLA-risk and waiting-client replies in the first available slot — a batch of
     quick replies early buys quiet for the rest of the day.
   - Give deep-work tickets the longest uninterrupted gap, and say which gap that is.
   - Leave ~20% unallocated as reactive buffer for walk-ins and new urgents — a
     100%-booked plan is a fiction; say the buffer is deliberate. If I insist on
     packing it, note the risk once and comply.
   - Respect energy: nothing cognitively heavy in the last 30 minutes; that slot is
     for wrap-up notes and time entries.

4. Present the plan as a timeline, times in my timezone
   ("8:30–9:00 — reply batch: #123, #456, #789"), each block with its tickets and
   objective.

5. Be explicit about the cut line: which tickets did NOT make today's plan and where
   they land instead (tomorrow / needs scheduling / delegate candidate). An honest
   "won't fit" beats a fantasy plan. If the queue clearly exceeds the day even before
   planning, say so at the TOP and lead with the triage decision (what to drop,
   escalate, or reschedule), not a compressed impossible timeline.

6. Offer follow-ups: draft the reply batch, or set schedule entries on the planned
   tickets — but the plan is advisory. Do not create or modify schedule entries,
   tickets, or reminders unless I explicitly confirm I want it written back. Never
   invent calendar events, and re-plan willingly when reality diverges.
