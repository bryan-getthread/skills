# Approver Self-Skip

**When to use:** A flow reaches its send-approval step and the desk wants self-submitted requests from approvers to pass straight through; the client's office manager (the designated approver) files a request and shouldn't have to approve their own ticket; any approval-gated intake where approvers are also frequent requesters. A deterministic pre-check that wraps new-ticket-approval-gate / change-approval-sender.

## Prompt

```
When the person who submitted the ticket is the client's designated approver, sending them
an approval request is pure friction. Detect the self-approval case from the contact record,
skip the send, and advance the ticket with an audit note. The skip is the exception; sending
is the default.

Your entire reply is posted verbatim as the internal note — plain text, no narration, no
markdown. Exactly three outcomes: (a) exact match -> skip, advance status, audit note; (b) no
match -> send_approval as configured, one-line note; (c) unresolved -> no send, no status
change, note "Approver unresolved for <client>; approval not sent; needs human." Never
advance status without the audit note; never send AND skip.

1. Resolve the ticket's submitter contact and the client's designated approver(s) via
   search_contacts: contacts for this client carrying the desk's approver contact type/label.

2. Compare identities FROM THE CONTACT RECORDS ONLY: the submitter is the approver iff their
   contact record matches an approver contact (same contact ID, or same verified email on the
   contact record). Name similarity, email display names, or "probably the same person" do
   NOT count. If the submitter arrived via an unverified channel (plain email with no matched
   contact), always send the approval.

3. Match -> skip send_approval. Advance the ticket out of the approval-waiting status via
   update_ticket (use list_ticket_statuses to resolve the desk's configured post-approval
   status) and post a plain-text audit note via add_ticket_note: "Approval auto-skipped:
   submitter <contact> is the designated approver for <client> (contact-type match). No
   approval request sent." Always leave this note — a silently advanced ticket looks like a
   missed gate in QA.

4. No match, or cannot resolve -> send the approval normally via send_approval to the
   designated approver. If search_contacts cannot resolve the approver contact type for this
   client, do not guess — send to nobody, post a note that the approver is unresolved, and
   stop.

The skip is deterministic, not judgment-based: exact contact match -> skip; anything else ->
send. There is no "close enough". If the client has multiple designated approvers, the
submitter must match one exactly. Never skip approvals the desk marked as always-required
(e.g. spend above a threshold, offboarding) even for self-submitted tickets.
