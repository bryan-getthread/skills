# Password Reset Intent Design

**When to use:** "Build an intent for password resets" / "half our tickets are password resets — can Magic handle them?" / Intent Mining ranked password reset as the top build candidate.

## Prompt

```
Build a password-reset intent that pushes users to self-service reset (SSPR) first and
routes everything else to a verified human handoff. The intent NEVER resets a password
itself — it deflects to SSPR or produces a well-formed, identity-flagged ticket. Intent
tools are admin-only; if absent, output the complete written spec for an admin to apply.

Design the intent to this spec:
- Trigger phrases (adapt to real ticket language): "forgot my password", "reset my
  password", "can't log in", "cant login", "locked out of my account", "password expired",
  "my password isn't working", "account locked", "pw reset", "need a new password", "login
  not working", "I keep getting invalid password". Keep triggers generic to account/directory
  sign-in; "can't log in to <specific app>" may belong to an application-specific intent.
- Arguments: which system/account (directory/M365 vs a specific application — routes the
  reply); whether they can still receive MFA / access their registered recovery method
  (decides SSPR vs handoff); device context only if the client's SSPR flow differs by device.
- Reply flow (SSPR-first ladder): (1) directory/M365 + user can use their recovery method ->
  reply with the client's SSPR link and exact steps, then ask "did that work?"; (2) SSPR
  succeeded -> confirm resolution, close as deflected; (3) SSPR failed / no recovery method /
  no SSPR -> create a ticket flagged "identity verification required" with the collected
  arguments, and tell the user a technician will verify identity before any reset.
- Handoff rule (non-negotiable): any path ending in a human changing a credential must state
  identity verification happens first. The intent never communicates a password, never resets
  one, never bypasses MFA.
- Variation hooks (per client): SSPR portal URL, identity provider, whether SSPR is enabled
  at all (if not, skip straight to verified-ticket path), verification-policy wording.
- Success metric: deflection rate on password-reset conversations (matched conversations
  ending without a ticket); watch false-match rate on the near-miss test set.

Steps:
1. list_intents — if a password/login intent exists, propose updating it (get_intent ->
   update_intent) rather than duplicating.
2. search_tickets for 5–10 recent real password/lockout tickets; mirror users' actual
   phrasing in the trigger set and note which systems come up.
3. search_knowledge_base for an existing SSPR article; reference it in the reply instead of
   restating steps that may drift.
4. Draft the full spec (triggers, arguments, reply ladder, handoff wording, variations) and
   a test plan — 5 utterances that should match, 3–5 near-misses ("reset the printer",
   "password for the wifi") that should not. Show it before any write.
5. On explicit confirmation ONLY: create_intent, then set_variation_arguments /
   set_variation_replies / update_variation per client variation.
6. Report what was created, restate the test plan, recommend the admin activate only after
   the test utterances pass. Do NOT activate.

Guardrails: credential actions ALWAYS hand off to a verified human path — never reveal, set,
or reset a password, or walk a user around MFA. Do not invent the client's SSPR URL or
verification policy; leave a placeholder and flag it as required before activation. Replies
are customer-facing: plain, localizable, no jargon, no fabricated turnaround promises. Never
write without showing the complete draft and getting explicit confirmation.
