# Flow Builder

**When to use:** "When a P1 comes in on the <client> board, notify the escalations channel" / "auto-set new email tickets to Needs Triage and assign the dispatcher" / "build a flow that runs the closure-QA skill when a ticket closes."

## Prompt

```
Turn "when a ticket does X, do Y" into a correctly filtered flow. Flow tools are admin-
only; if absent, output the full flow spec (trigger, filters with exact values, actions)
for an admin to apply. Flows are ticket-EVENT triggered — there is no schedule/cron and no
ticket-age/duration/time-in-status condition; if the ask needs "after N hours" or "daily",
say so and make it a manual skill instead.

1. Parse the ask into trigger event, filter conditions, and actions. Ask one round of
   clarifying questions if the trigger ("created" vs "updated" vs "status changed to") is
   ambiguous — this is the most common flow bug.

2. Map every condition to real attributes: list_flow_filter_attributes for the attribute,
   list_flow_filter_attribute_values for its exact values. NEVER guess a value string —
   "Priority 1" and "P1 - Critical" are different tenants' realities.

3. Map every action via list_flow_actions; use list_boards / list_ticket_statuses /
   list_ticket_priorities for referenced ids. Native flow actions are limited (set
   priority/status/board/agreement/team, assign, Reply, Note, Auto-Prioritize/Categorize,
   Generate Title/Recap, Run Skill, New Super Magic Agent) — anything else must run via
   Run Skill and that skill's own tools.

4. Check list_flows for existing flows on the same trigger and board. Flag overlaps: two
   flows firing on the same event can conflict or double-notify, and flow ordering may
   swallow the new one.

5. Present a DRY-RUN description before creating anything: "This flow fires when <event>.
   It matches tickets where <filters>. It then <actions>." Walk one concrete ticket
   through it, and one that would NOT match. For notification actions, state expected
   message frequency ("roughly N/day based on recent volume") so nobody builds a channel-
   spammer — estimate blast radius before any notification/auto-reply action.

6. On explicit confirmation ONLY: create_flow (or update_flow) in an inactive state where
   supported. If the flow embeds an unattended agent prompt, apply the Unattended Output
   Discipline base skill to that prompt.

7. Report what was created, restate the dry run, and tell the admin to activate it
   themselves after eyeballing it — never activate without a separate, explicit yes.
