# Teams Meeting Guide

**When to use:** "User has a big Teams meeting tomorrow — send a how-to." / "Send <user> steps to share their screen / record the meeting." / post-incident follow-up after a meeting went badly.

**Run it:** on one ticket.

## Prompt

```
Draft a client-ready instruction block for the anxious meeting host: how to join cleanly, check
audio before anyone hears them, share a screen, and (policy permitting) record — sized to what the
user actually asked, not a full Teams manual. Verify the environment before you write; when unsure,
ask. Draft only — show me the reply as a draft to review first, and don't send it.

1. Verify the environment FIRST by checking the client's documentation and past tickets: the client actually runs Teams (not another platform), whether the user
   has the desktop app or joins via browser, and — if recording is in scope — whether the client's
   policy permits recording for regular users. If the recording policy is unknown and the user asked
   about recording, ask the technician ONE question rather than promising a button that may be
   disabled.
2. Write ONLY the sections the user needs (join / audio / sharing / recording), each to end-user
   rules, one action per step with what-you'll-see cues:
   - Join: click the meeting link in the calendar invite; cue the pre-join screen ("you'll see
     yourself on camera with buttons for mic and camera BEFORE anyone can see or hear you — nothing
     is live yet"). This one cue removes most meeting anxiety.
   - Audio check: on the pre-join screen, confirm the named mic/speaker matches their headset; the
     test-call-style check where available ("look for a settings gear on the pre-join screen").
     Off-ramp: "If your headset isn't in the list, stop and reply before the meeting — usually a
     quick fix on our side."
   - Sharing: the share button cue, and the key distinction in plain words: sharing one WINDOW (they
     only ever see that window — safest) vs the whole SCREEN (everything, including notifications).
     Recommend window-share by default; suggest closing email and chat first regardless.
   - Recording (ONLY if policy-verified): where the record option lives (the "…" more menu), the cue
     that everyone is notified recording started, where the recording lands afterwards, and the
     etiquette line ("announce you're recording"). If policy blocks it, say so plainly instead of
     describing a button they don't have.
   - Day-of safety net: "Join 5 minutes early. If anything looks different from these steps, reply or
     call the desk — before the meeting, not during."
3. Assemble per the Email Baseline Standard.

Guardrails: never describe features the client's policy disables (recording, external sharing) —
verify or ask; a missing button the guide promised is a credibility hit. Keep it to what was asked —
sections not requested get one offer line ("Want a screen-sharing walkthrough too? Reply and we'll
send it"). Teams UI shifts constantly — cue by name and purpose ("the camera button"), never by
position or exact icon. No admin steps (meeting policies, org settings) in the user block. Recording
carries consent/legal weight in some jurisdictions — the announce-it line stays in every recording
section; never advise covert recording. Localizable. The client's documentation is available only when those integrations are enabled.
