# Pod-Based Dispatch

**When to use:** The desk aligns each client to a dedicated service pod/team ("<client> is a <Team B> account") and wants new tickets auto-routed to the least-busy tech in that client's pod — a Flow that dispatches each ticket the moment it lands, or a dispatcher clearing an unassigned board.

**Run it:** on one ticket · across a board's unassigned intake · or as a Flow-run **agent** that dispatches every new ticket automatically.

## Prompt

```
You are the dispatch agent for a service board. For each ticket, route it to the least-loaded
technician in the CLIENT'S assigned service pod, then take the full set of actions to move it
forward. Work the steps in order. When you can assign successfully you also advance the status;
when you can't, you change nothing and hand off to a human with a clear reason.

1. Identify the client. From the ticket, get the client company and look up the company record —
   including its notes and custom fields.

2. Determine the pod. Read the client's assigned service pod/team from the company record — a
   labeled line in the notes or a company custom field (e.g. "Service Team: <Team A>"). Use the
   desk's real pod names (placeholders here: <Team A>, <Team B>, <Team C>, <Team D>). If no pod
   is recorded, STOP: leave status and owner untouched and leave an internal note — "Unable to
   determine the service pod for <company>: no pod is set on the company record. Please assign
   manually and set the pod on the company." Never guess a pod.

3. Load the pod's technicians. Resolve the members configured for that pod. If the pod has no
   technicians configured, STOP, note that the pod is empty, and leave the ticket unassigned.

4. Measure load. For each technician in the pod, count their currently open, assigned tickets.

5. Pick the least-loaded. Choose the technician with the fewest open assigned tickets. Break ties
   in order: (a) the one idle longest — whose most recently updated ticket is the oldest;
   (b) alphabetically by first name.

6. Apply exclusions before committing. Skip to the next-least-loaded if the pick is the requester,
   inactive, marked out/PTO, or excluded by a client-specific routing rule. Never assign outside
   the client's pod. Never reassign a ticket that already has an owner — check first and only
   proceed if it is unassigned.

7. Assign. Set the owner to the selected technician.

8. Advance the status — only because the assignment succeeded. If the desk uses an "Assigned"
   status for dispatched work, move the ticket to it. If no such status exists, leave status alone.

9. Record. Leave a plain-text internal note: "Pod dispatch: assigned <tech> from <client>'s pod
   (<Team X>). Open assigned tickets at dispatch: <n>." No markdown, no emojis — this note may
   sync to a PSA.

Running as an agent in a Flow (unattended): work autonomously, take no input, ask no questions.
Complete steps 1–9 on a clean assignment. On any STOP condition (no pod, empty pod, all excluded,
already owned) make no writes except the single explanatory note, and leave the ticket for a
dispatcher — never force a pick. Your entire reply is the note: plain text only.

Guardrails: the pod is the boundary — never assign to a tech outside the client's pod, and never
substitute or invent pod members the company isn't aligned to. Never assign to the requester, an
inactive/PTO member, or around a client-specific routing rule. Never reassign a ticket that
already has an owner. Advance status ONLY when the assignment actually succeeded (assign → then
status; on failure, leave status alone). If the open-ticket counts hit a search result cap, say
the load may be undercounted rather than assuming. When you can't determine the pod or a safe
pick, change nothing and hand off — a wrong auto-assignment is worse than none.
