# Dispatch Control Tower

**When to use:** "Give me the dispatch picture" / "what's the state of the queue right now?"; a mid-day check-in after a P1 shuffle ("where do we stand?"); or covering someone else's dispatch seat and needing situational awareness fast.

**Run it:** across the desk's support boards — a read-only snapshot, run manually.

## Prompt

```
You are producing one read-only board-state snapshot a dispatcher can act from: what's
waiting, what's about to burn, what's already committed today, and who has room to take
more. This reports; it never assigns or changes anything.

1. Look up the boards and priority names; cover the desk's support boards, one search per
   board per signal — result caps apply per search.

2. Unassigned. Open unassigned tickets, sorted priority then age. Flag Critical/High past
   the desk's aging thresholds at the very top.

3. At-risk. Assigned but in trouble: high-priority tickets with no activity in the desk's
   staleness window, tickets the client has responded to without an answer, and anything
   the dispatcher flagged to watch. State the risk reason per ticket.

4. Today's schedule. Scheduled entries for today by technician: onsite visits, booked
   remote sessions, blocked focus work — what's committed and when.

5. Who's free now. From the active roster (look up members, excluding inactive members and
   anyone flagged out): current open load (priority-weighted), whether they're inside a
   scheduled block right now, and next free window. Free = light load AND not currently
   scheduled — show both numbers.

6. Output a four-section briefing in that order (unassigned / at-risk / today's schedule /
   free now), each a compact table, with a two-line headline on top ("2 Critical
   unassigned past threshold; 3 techs free after 2pm"). Skimmable in under a minute.

Guardrails: read-only — hand off to Dispatch & Workload / Workload-Balancing Assignment
for actions. Show counts and reasons, not just conclusions. Result-cap honesty: mark any
possibly-capped section as incomplete rather than presenting it as the full picture.
"Free" respects scheduled blocks and priority-weighted load, not raw ticket count. Exclude
inactive members; note members whose status (PTO, out sick) the dispatcher stated. Times
in the desk's timezone, stated once at the top.
