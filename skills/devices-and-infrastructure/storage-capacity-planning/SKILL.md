description: Turn repeated disk-space alerts into a trend-based capacity forecast per server/NAS — growth rate, projected full date, and an expansion-options brief the account team can price. Use when a device alerts on disk for the third time, or someone asks "how long until this fills up" or "what should we buy".

# Storage Capacity Planning

**When to use:** The same server/NAS has alerted on disk more than once, "how long until <server>'s data drive is full?", or the account team wants an expansion recommendation.

**Run it:** on one server/NAS volume, on demand (not a Flow — it's a trend forecast and options brief, not a per-ticket event).

## Prompt

```
Stop treating the same disk alert as a new incident: reconstruct the growth trend from alert and ticket history, project when the volume actually fills, and produce an options brief — clean up, expand, or re-architect. This needs the RMM connected for current state.

1. Establish current state: read the device details for present capacity and free space per volume; the documentation (IT Glue / Hudu) for what the volume holds (file shares, databases, backup targets — the workload determines both growth character and expansion options). Resolve org->device without stopping to ask mid-lookup; don't trust a class filter.
2. Reconstruct the trend from history (the RMM exposes point-in-time readings only): harvest prior data points from the device's alerts and recent activity (each threshold alert is a dated reading) and from ticket history for earlier disk tickets that recorded free-space figures. Three or more dated points make a usable trend; fewer means the honest output is "insufficient history — start recording, re-forecast in N weeks" plus the current-state brief.
3. Compute growth honestly: rate per month from the points you have, projected-full date at the current rate, and a sensitivity line ("at 1.5x the rate, full by <earlier date>"). Deduct known one-off events (a migration, a cleanup) from the trend rather than letting them distort it — say when you did. State the forecast as a range, not a date certain.
4. Separate reclaimable from organic growth: old user profiles, stale snapshots, log bloat, duplicate backup copies are reclaimable (route quick wins via disk-space-remediation); steady LOB data growth is organic and cleanup only rents time. Quantify roughly how much runway cleanup buys versus the growth rate.
5. Expansion-options brief, matched to the platform from documentation: extend the volume/datastore (if underlying storage has headroom), add disks/shelf (check slot availability and warranty/EOL — cross-reference hardware-refresh-forecast, since expanding a dying unit is money misspent), tier or archive cold data, or move the workload (larger NAS, SAN, cloud). For each: rough effort class, disruption (window needed?), and how much runway it buys at the observed rate. No vendor pricing from memory — sizing and prices are for the account team to quote.
6. Output: current state, trend with data points shown, projected-full range, reclaimable-vs-organic split, and the options table. Leave the plain-text summary as a note (no markdown/emojis), and open a ticket for the account team when the projected-full date is inside the client's typical procurement lead time.

Guardrails: never present a projected-full date as certain — always a range with the data points that produced it visible. A forecast from fewer than three dated readings is labeled low-confidence or not issued; do not dress up two points as a trend. Cleanup recommendations name what the files are believed to be and require verification before deletion — nothing is deleted by this skill. No hardware model or price quotes from memory. Do not forecast backup-target volumes as if they were organic data growth — retention settings, not users, drive them; say when a volume's growth is policy-driven.
