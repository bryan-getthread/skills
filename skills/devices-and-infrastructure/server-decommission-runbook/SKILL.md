# Server Decommission Runbook

**When to use:** "Decommission <server> — it's being replaced", retiring a physical host / VM / legacy app server, or confirming a server is genuinely safe to power off.

## Prompt

```
Retire a server without breaking the services that quietly depend on it. Dependency-first, approval-gated: prove nothing still relies on the box before it is wiped, then clean up every record it touched. This skill plans, verifies, and documents only — the wipe/power-off/deletion are human actions behind approval.

1. Identify the server and its role: search_ninjaone_devices then get_ninjaone_device for OS, role hints, last contact, installed agents (do not trust node_class). Pull the asset and its documented purpose from search_itglue and any decommission checklist from search_knowledge_base.
2. Map dependencies before proposing anything destructive. Check for: roles the box holds (DC/DNS/DHCP/CA/file/print/SQL/app), services other systems consume, scheduled tasks, shares and mapped drives, DNS records pointing at it, backup jobs, monitoring. Where the partner runs Liongard, use liongard_launchpoint to find the relevant inspectors (AD, DNS, DHCP, hypervisor, backup) and liongard_metric/liongard_timeline to read current config and confirm what references this host. Verify each inspector last ran successfully and state dataprint age; where no inspector exists, fall back to documentation + RMM and say the dependency check is partial.
3. Check recent activity (get_ninjaone_device_activities) for live sessions or users still hitting the box — active use is a stop condition until confirmed.
4. Produce a pre-decommission plan listing, per dependency: what must be migrated, repointed, or confirmed dead first (data migration, DNS/record changes, backup-job removal, monitoring removal, license reclamation). Nothing is marked done that you cannot verify.
5. Gate the destructive phase behind explicit sign-off: route the plan through send_approval so a human authorizes the wipe/power-off. Do not represent the shutdown or wipe as something this skill performs.
6. On approval, hand off execution: the actual power-off, disk wipe, and hypervisor/RMM removal are performed by the tech in-console (there is no RMM script-exec or delete path through this skill). Track the record changes (DNS, backup, monitoring, licensing) as they are completed.
7. Close out documentation: mark the asset retired with date and reason, remove it from active inventory. Post the runbook status as a plain-text note (add_ticket_note, no markdown/emojis), or create_ticket if none exists.

Guardrails: dependency mapping is mandatory before any destructive step — never propose a wipe/power-off until dependencies are accounted for and data is confirmed migrated. The wipe, power-off, and deletion are human actions behind send_approval; do not claim to have deleted or wiped anything. Trust Liongard/RMM data only after confirming the inspector/agent last ran; always state dataprint/last-contact age; degrade to docs when a source is absent and say the check is partial. Never remove backup jobs or retention until the retention policy for the retired system is confirmed — the data may be needed after the box is gone.
