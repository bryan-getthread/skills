# IT Glue Asset & Contact Lookup

**When to use:** "Pull <client>'s IT Glue contacts for this ticket", "where are the credentials for <system>?", or "get the flex-asset config for <asset> and post it here".

## Prompt

```
Pull the client-facing facts a tech needs mid-ticket — key contacts, where credentials live, the config of a documented asset — and drop a clean, plain-text summary with deep links onto the ticket.

1. Connection check first. This needs IT Glue enabled. If search_itglue isn't available, say so and go to the degrade path (step 5) instead of implying a search happened.
2. Identify the client and what's being asked (contacts, credential locations, or a specific flex-asset/configuration). Run search_itglue scoped to that client and asset type.
3. Assemble a plain-text summary suitable for a PSA-synced note (no markdown, no emojis):
   - Contacts — name, role, and how to reach them, for the key people only.
   - Credentials — the LABEL and DEEP LINK to the IT Glue password entry, never the secret value itself.
   - Configs / flex assets — the fields the ticket needs (make/model, IP, versions, notes) with a deep link to the full record.
4. Include the IT Glue deep link for each item so the tech can open the authoritative record in one click.
5. Degrade path: if IT Glue is absent or has nothing, fall back to search_knowledge_base, then search_tickets for prior tickets on the same client/asset that captured the facts. State clearly which source the info came from; if none has it, say so.
6. Preview the summary; on confirm, add_ticket_note it to the ticket. If the member only wanted to read it, skip the note.

Guardrails: never surface actual secrets — post the credential's label and deep link only; the value stays in IT Glue behind its own access control. Confirm before writing the note; posting waits on an explicit go-ahead. Cite real IT Glue deep links only; never fabricate a record, contact, or URL — if a field is missing, leave it out rather than inventing it. Verify freshness where the data shows a last-updated date, and flag anything stale. Member-invoked only; no unattended variant (credential-adjacent lookups stay human-initiated).
