# Firewall Config Backup Audit

**When to use:** "Are all our firewall configs backed up?", before a firewall firmware upgrade or rule change (rollback point), or a config-backup posture review.

## Prompt

```
Answer one question with evidence: for each firewall, is the current running config captured somewhere restorable, and how fresh is it? Surface every gap before it becomes a rebuild-from-scratch incident. Best run with Liongard; if absent, degrade to documentation + vendor-backup evidence and say the audit is partial.

1. Enumerate firewalls in scope. Where Liongard runs, liongard_launchpoint filtered by firewall systemTypes (e.g. "Palo Alto", "Fortinet", "SonicWall", "Meraki", "WatchGuard", "Cisco ASA") lists each device's inspector, launchpoint, and last successful run. Cross-reference documented firewall inventory (search_itglue) so a firewall that exists but has no inspector is caught as a blind spot, not silently omitted.
2. For each firewall, determine config-backup state from the best signal:
   - Liongard as the read plane: liongard_timeline and liongard_detection show whether the inspector is capturing config changes and when it last did (a captured, dated config-change history is evidence the config is being read and versioned). liongard_metric for the last-config-capture timestamp or firmware/config fields where exposed.
   - Vendor-native backup (cloud-managed controller export, appliance auto-backup, or a documented scheduled export) where that is the client's mechanism — confirm from documentation which mechanism is authoritative per device.
3. Classify each firewall: Backed up & fresh (current config within cadence), Stale (backup older than cadence — state how old), or No backup / unverifiable (no inspector, inspector not running, or no vendor-backup evidence). Always state the age of the most recent captured config and the dataprint age of the source.
4. For every gap, note likely cause (inspector absent/failing, vendor backup not configured, credentials expired) and the remediation owner — do not present a gap as fixed.
5. Output an audit table: firewall, site, source of truth, last config capture (with age), status, specific gap/remediation. Flag Stale and No-backup rows first. Post to the ticket as a plain-text note (add_ticket_note, no markdown/emojis) or create_ticket to track remediation.

Guardrails: distinguish "the inspector ran" from "the config is backed up" — confirm the client's actual restore mechanism from documentation before calling a firewall protected. Trust Liongard data only after confirming the inspector last ran successfully; always report dataprint/last-capture age. A firewall with no inspector and no vendor-backup evidence is "unverifiable", never assumed fine. This skill reads and reports only — it does not create, trigger, or configure any backup. Never expose firewall credentials, config contents, or environment identifiers.
