# Endpoint Encryption Audit

**When to use:** "Are all of <client>'s laptops encrypted?" for compliance/insurance, a lost-device breach-severity question, or "do we actually have the BitLocker keys for these machines?"

## Prompt

```
Two mandatory questions: is every endpoint's disk encrypted, and if a device died tomorrow could the desk retrieve its recovery key? Coverage without escrow is a lockout; escrow without coverage is a breach.

1. Build the endpoint population from the RMM (search_ninjaone_devices, verify workstation/laptop class in details — do not trust node_class) — this is the denominator. If listings may have capped, the denominator is "at least N" and the audit says so.
2. Gather encryption state per device, best source first: RMM device details (get_ninjaone_device) where it exposes encryption/volume status; Liongard Windows and M365/Entra inspectors (liongard_launchpoint to confirm the inspector exists and last ran successfully, then liongard_metric / liongard_query for BitLocker status and escrowed-key presence — state dataprint age); documentation (search_itglue / search_hudu) last, with staleness named. Devices with no encryption evidence go in an "unknown" bucket — unknown is not unencrypted, and it is definitely not encrypted.
3. Bucket the fleet: encrypted with key escrowed, encrypted with NO escrow evidence (one dead motherboard from permanent data loss), not encrypted, and unknown. Macs: FileVault status typically needs MDM data (Liongard/Intune path or MDM export); if no Mac source exists, the Mac fleet is "unknown", stated plainly.
4. Escrow verification — evidence, not assumption: identify where keys should live (Entra/AD, MDM, doc-platform flagged fields, per client policy from docs) and verify presence for audited devices. Presence of a key object is the pass bar; confirming a key unlocks its volume is a hands-on test — recommend it for a sample, never claim it.
5. Flag and route: unencrypted -> remediation ticket (create_ticket; enabling encryption is policy/hands-on, and old hardware without TPM needs per-device assessment); encrypted-without-escrow -> "capture key before anything else" ticket flagged urgent-quiet (no reboots, no firmware updates on that device until the key is escrowed); unknowns -> a verification pass. Check search_tickets for an existing encryption project before opening duplicates.
6. Output: coverage summary (encrypted+escrowed / encrypted-no-escrow / unencrypted / unknown, with percentages against the stated denominator), per-bucket device lists, evidence source and freshness per claim, tickets opened. Post the plain-text summary via add_ticket_note (no markdown/emojis). For compliance requests, state clearly this is a point-in-time technical audit, not a compliance certification.

Guardrails: recovery keys are NEVER reproduced in any output, note, or ticket — location and existence only (a key pasted into a ticket is itself a security incident). "Unknown" is its own honest bucket — never fold it into either side. Encrypted-without-escrow devices must not be rebooted, firmware-updated, or have TPM changes until the key is captured. Every encryption claim carries its evidence source and age; inspector data is used only when the launchpoint shows a successful recent run. This skill enables nothing and rotates nothing. If neither RMM nor Liongard is available, degrade to docs + ticket history and label it "unverified — evidence-gathering pass required".
