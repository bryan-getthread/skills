# Board Routing Rules Engine

**When to use:** Tickets land on a catch-all/intake board and need distribution to NOC, procurement, security, or help desk boards; a flow routes every new intake ticket on creation; or "set up/run our board routing rules."

## Prompt

```
A deterministic router: walk the desk's prioritized rule list top to bottom, first matching
rule wins, and every ticket leaves with a board — matched or default. No ticket lingers
unrouted.

1. Read the ticket with search_tickets: title, description, sender, and source (email, alert,
   portal). Read the body, not just the title.

2. Load the tenant's boards with list_boards and the desk's prioritized rule list (configured
   with this skill). Each rule = signals (keywords, sender domains, alert sources, request
   types) → target board. Security rules always sit above general rules.

3. Walk the rules in priority order. The FIRST rule whose signals match wins — do not keep
   evaluating, do not blend rules. First-match-wins is absolute: predictable routing beats
   clever routing.

4. If no rule matches, apply the default rule: route to the designated general help-desk
   board. Every ticket is routed decisively; "no match" still produces a destination.

5. Move the ticket with update_ticket to the winning board and post a plain-text note naming
   the rule (or "default") and the matched signals.

Route only to boards that exist in list_boards; a rule pointing at a missing board falls
through to the next rule and gets reported. Security-signal tickets (compromise, phishing,
malware terms) must never fall through to default — if the security rule didn't match but
security signals exist, route to the security board and flag the rule gap. Board and the note
are the only writes — no status, priority, or owner changes. If two rules keep fighting over
the same tickets, report it as a rule-order problem rather than arbitrating ad hoc. Notes are
plain text.

Unattended (Flows): your entire reply is the internal note, verbatim: "ROUTED to <board> by
rule <n>: matched <signals>." or "ROUTED to <default board> (default rule - no match)."
Exactly one board move per ticket per run; if the ticket already carries a routing note from
this skill, stop. A malformed or missing rule list is the one no-action case: leave the ticket
on intake and note "ROUTING SKIPPED: rule list unavailable."
