# Catchall Routing

**When to use:** A ticket has no company assigned or sits on a catchall/no-company contact; forwarded mail ("FW:") is attributed to the forwarder not the original sender; a vendor/monitoring alert landed in the catchall; or a periodic sweep of the intake board to remap misattributed tickets.

## Prompt

```
Route a ticket that arrived with no company (or on a catchall contact) to the real
client and contact using an explicit evidence ladder — or leave it alone when the
evidence isn't there.

1. Read the ticket with search_tickets: title, description, earliest message, and full
   headers/quoted text if present.

2. Spam pre-check: if the message is clearly unsolicited marketing or automated junk with
   no client-identifying content and no sign a human forwarded it in for a reason, stop
   and flag it as spam for review instead of routing it. Do not close spam unattended —
   flag via note only.

3. Extract identity clues in this order of strength (the evidence ladder):
   a. Email domain of the true sender (strongest),
   b. An explicit company name stated in the body or alert fields,
   c. A person's name alone (weakest — never sufficient by itself).

4. If the subject starts with "FW:" or the body contains a quoted original message, parse
   the original "From:" line and use that sender — not the forwarder — as the identity
   source.

5. If the ticket is a vendor/monitoring alert, extract the structured fields (site name,
   organization, device, tenant) from the alert body and use those as the company clue.

6. Resolve the company with search_clients on the domain or extracted name; then find the
   contact with search_contacts scoped to that company. If the sender has no contact
   record, propose the closest match or note that one needs creating — never attach to a
   lookalike.

7. If the current wrong assignment must be cleared before the correct one can apply on
   this tenant, unassign first (set back to no-company/catchall), then apply the correct
   company and contact.

8. Apply the match with update_ticket and assign_contact ONLY when exactly one company
   candidate fits at domain or explicit-name strength. Ambiguity (two or more plausible
   companies) → make no change; list candidates and ask. Never assign on name similarity
   alone.

9. If the tenant's PSA sync rejects company changes on an existing ticket, use the
   close-and-recreate path: create_ticket under the correct company with the original
   text and a plain-text note cross-referencing both ticket numbers, then close the
   original — but only with my confirmation (this is destructive-adjacent), never
   unattended.

10. Post a plain-text internal note with add_ticket_note stating what was matched, which
    evidence rung was used, and what changed.

A PSA-bound ticket must always have a company — if no match is possible, route it to the
designated internal/catchall client per desk policy and flag it; never leave it
companyless. Notes destined for the PSA are plain text — no markdown, no emojis. Do not
invent companies, contacts, or ticket numbers; if searches may have capped, say so.

Unattended (Flows): act only at domain-match or explicit-company strength; on anything
weaker, make no change and post one plain-text internal note: "CATCHALL ROUTING: no
confident match. Evidence found: <clues>. Left unassigned for human review." Never use
close-and-recreate unattended. One remap per ticket per run; if the ticket already
carries a routing note from this skill, stop. Your entire reply is the internal note —
no narration, no questions.
