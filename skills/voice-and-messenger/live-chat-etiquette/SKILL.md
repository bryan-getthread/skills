# Live Chat Etiquette

Chat is a different contract than email: the client is sitting there watching the typing indicator. This skill drafts chat messages and coaches chat conduct against the cadence, holding, handoff, and closing rules that keep live conversations from going quiet or going wrong.

## When to use

- "Draft my next reply in this Messenger chat."
- "Write a holding message — I need 10 minutes to dig into this."
- "How do I hand this chat to <team> without making the user re-explain?"
- "Write our chat etiquette playbook for new techs."

## Steps

1. Read the live thread via `search_tickets` (or the pasted chat) — cadence rules depend on how long the client has already been waiting and what was last promised.
2. Apply the cadence contract:
   - Acknowledge within the desk's first-touch window even without an answer — "looking at this now" beats a perfect reply five minutes later.
   - Never go silent longer than the interval you last set. Every quiet stretch needs a holding message *before* it starts, with a duration: "I need about 10 minutes to check the server — I'll message you by 2:15."
   - When a promised check-in time arrives and you're not done, check in anyway with the new estimate. Re-promising is fine; ghosting is not.
3. Draft in chat register: short lines, one question at a time, no email formalities ("Dear...", signature blocks), no walls of text — split anything long into sequential messages. Mirror the client's formality; stay on the professional side of it.
4. Holding messages state three things: what you're doing, how long, and what they can do meanwhile (nothing is a valid answer — "no action needed on your side").
5. Handoffs: never make the user repeat themselves. Before transferring, post the one-line context summary *into the thread* ("Handing you to <team>: they'll see that your VPN drops every ~10 min since Monday's update"). The receiving tech opens with confirmation of that context, not "how can I help?". If the handoff means a wait, say how long and offer the async fallback ("they'll reply here within the hour — you don't need to keep the window open").
6. Ending cleanly: confirm the outcome in one line, state what happens next (ticket number, follow-up time, or "this is resolved — reopen by replying here"), and let the client close last where practice allows. A chat that became real work exits through Chat-to-Ticket Conversion, and the client is told the ticket number before the chat ends.
7. For playbook requests: assemble the rules above into a desk-specific one-pager, pulling any existing standards from `search_knowledge_base` so the output extends rather than contradicts current policy.

## Guardrails

- Never promise a response interval the desk can't keep; a cadence rule that gets broken daily trains clients to distrust the channel.
- No troubleshooting steps with destructive potential over chat without the same confirmation you'd require by email — speed is not consent.
- Chat is still the record: everything lands on the ticket thread; no "off the record" guidance.
- Don't simulate typing-status or presence claims you can't see; base cadence judgments on message timestamps only.
- `view_openDraft` is in-app SuperAgent only — from external MCP, output the drafted message text for the member to paste.
- Localizable phrasing: avoid idioms; many desks run chats in the client's language — draft in the thread's language.
