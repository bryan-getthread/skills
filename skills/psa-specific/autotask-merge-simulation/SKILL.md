# Autotask Merge Simulation

**When to use:** Two Autotask-synced tickets are confirmed duplicates and someone says "merge these", or merge_ticket is unavailable/fails for this tenant and the desk syncs to Autotask.

## Prompt

```
You are simulating a merge on an Autotask desk. Thread's merge_ticket cannot merge tickets in
Autotask because Autotask exposes no merge operation — a "merge" is simulated by cross-
referencing and completing the duplicate. The ordering is strict: notes and history move
BEFORE the source ticket is completed, because a completed Autotask ticket may be locked to
further edits by workflow rules.

1. Verify the duplicate — re-fetch both tickets at full detail with search_tickets. Require a
   strong identifier match (same alert ID, same asset, same contact + same specific error in a
   recent window), never wording similarity. Confirm neither ticket was completed in Autotask
   since you last looked.

2. Pick the survivor — normally the older ticket, or the one with client correspondence, time
   entries, or SLA history. The other becomes the source. State the choice and reasoning; get
   confirmation before any write.

3. Match queue and fields — ensure the survivor sits on the correct queue with correct
   issue/sub-issue classification so nothing is lost when the source disappears from view. Fix
   with update_ticket if needed.

4. Cross-note both tickets (plain text, this syncs to Autotask):
   - On the survivor: "Duplicate ticket <source number> merged into this ticket on <date>.
     Summary of source: <requester, one-line issue, any unique detail, time worked>." Carry
     over any detail that exists only on the source — attachments cannot move, so name them
     and where they live.
   - On the source: "Duplicate of <survivor number>. All further work tracked there. No
     action will be taken on this ticket."

5. Complete the source LAST — only after both notes are confirmed written, set the source to
   the desk's duplicate-closure status via update_ticket (typically Complete with a
   "Duplicate" resolution type if the desk uses one). Never complete first: a completed source
   you can no longer annotate strands the history.

6. Output: survivor and source numbers, both note texts, and the source's final status. If any
   step fails midway, stop and report exactly which step completed — do not improvise the rest.

Always: ordering is non-negotiable — verify → survivor → fields → cross-notes → complete
source. Completing the source early is the one unrecoverable mistake. Re-fetch both tickets
immediately before step 4 and again before step 5 — a client reply landing on the source mid-
merge means stop and reassess. Never merge on wording similarity; strong identifiers only.
When in doubt, cross-reference the tickets with notes and leave both open for a human. Never
merge a ticket that has open time entries, an active SLA target, or unanswered client messages
on the source without explicit confirmation. All notes plain text — they sync to Autotask. If
the client emailed both tickets, warn that replies to the source's thread may reopen it in
Autotask.
