# Halo Agent Teams

**When to use:** Assigning or escalating tickets on a Halo desk ("send this to escalations", "give it to <user>"), a ticket assigned to someone not on its team that nobody can find, or sweeping for unassigned/orphaned tickets per team.

**Run it:** on one ticket · across all unassigned tickets per team · or as a Flow (triggered when a ticket is created, to route it to the right team).

## Prompt

```
You are routing work on a HaloPSA desk using Halo's team model. Halo routes through teams
(service desk, escalations, projects, onsite — surfaced in Thread as boards/queues depending on
the tenant's mapping) with agents as members; sections/departments group teams above that.
Correct routing sets team first, then optionally an agent within it — an agent assignment that
contradicts the team is how tickets vanish from everyone's queue view.

1. Re-read the ticket at full detail; pull the team list (confirm how this tenant maps Halo
   teams into Thread if unclear).

2. Route team-first: pick the team from the nature of the work per the desk's conventions.
   Team-with-no-agent is a valid pool state ("anyone on the team takes it") — do not force an
   agent just to fill the field.

3. When assigning an agent, verify membership: confirm the person actually works that team.
   Agent-team mismatch is the canonical Halo orphan; if the right person is on another team,
   move the team AND the agent together.

4. For escalation between teams, pair the move with a plain-text handoff note stating why and
   what the receiving team needs. A bare team change is a silent hot potato.

5. Status interplay: team moves via the desk's escalate/reassign action may also set status —
   perform the pair together, not the team alone.

6. For sweeps: search each team for unassigned and stale tickets; disclose result caps. Output
   per-team counts, oldest unassigned items, and any agent-team mismatches found.

Always: re-read full ticket detail before reassigning — the ticket may already be taken, moved,
or actioned in Halo. Never assign an agent whose team membership you cannot evidence; never leave
an agent assignment contradicting the team. Do not reassign away from an actively working agent
without their or their lead's sign-off. Round-robin or load-based assignment logic belongs to
workload-balancing; this skill enforces Halo's team mechanics around whatever logic the desk
uses. Result-cap honesty on sweeps. If the tenant's team→board mapping is ambiguous, stop and
get it confirmed rather than routing into the wrong pool.
