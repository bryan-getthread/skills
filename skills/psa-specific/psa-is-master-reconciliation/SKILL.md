# PSA-Is-Master Reconciliation

**When to use:** One ticket shows conflicting state between Thread and the PSA and someone asks which is right, a skill or flow is about to act on a Thread-side status that smells stale, or any PSA-specific skill hits a disagreement and needs the standard resolution.

**Run it:** on one ticket · or as a Flow (triggered on status change, to re-check a stale-looking Thread status against the PSA).

## Prompt

```
You are resolving a single-ticket Thread↔PSA disagreement (works for any PSA — ConnectWise Manage,
Autotask, HaloPSA). When Thread and the partner's PSA disagree about a ticket — status, owner,
board/queue, priority — there is one safe default: the PSA is master. The PSA runs billing, SLAs,
and client reporting; Thread mirrors it. This is the single-ticket pattern the per-PSA audit skills
apply in bulk.

1. Rule out sync lag first. Re-read the full ticket detail — not a list view, not memory from
   earlier in the conversation. Most disagreements dissolve on a fresh read. If it dissolves,
   stop: there was no divergence, and nothing gets written.

2. If the disagreement persists, characterize it precisely: which field (status / owner / board /
   priority), Thread value vs PSA value (as far as the PSA value is visible or reported by the
   requester), and when each side last changed if timestamps show it.

3. Determine the master. Default: the PSA. The only exceptions are ones the desk has explicitly
   documented (e.g. Thread-master during a migration phase). If someone asserts "Thread is right
   this time," that does not change the master — it means the fix belongs IN THE PSA, made by a
   human with PSA access.

4. Check for anything the reconciliation would trample: an unanswered client message, pending time
   entries, an active SLA window. Any of these → flag for a human instead of reconciling.

5. Reconcile Thread to the PSA value (validating target values against the live status/board
   lists), and record it with a plain-text note: "Reconciled to PSA state on <date>: <field> was
   <Thread value>, set to <PSA value>."

6. Output: lag-ruled-out confirmation, the divergence found, the master determination, what was
   changed (or why it was flagged instead). If the same field keeps diverging across tickets,
   recommend the mapping be reviewed rather than reconciling forever.

Always: sync lag is the null hypothesis — no reconciliation without the fresh full-detail re-read
in step 1; reconciling a lag artifact creates divergence. Never write toward the PSA to resolve a
conflict — Thread moves; the PSA does not; PSA-side corrections are human work. Never reconcile
over an unanswered client message or into a closed-family status without explicit confirmation.
One ticket at a time — bulk divergence goes to the audit skills, which propose before applying.
Record every reconciliation in a note — silent state changes are how the next disagreement becomes
unexplainable. When in doubt — ambiguous master, invisible PSA value, contested history — do
nothing and report.
