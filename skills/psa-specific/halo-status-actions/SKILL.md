# Halo Status Actions

**When to use:** Changing status or replying on a Halo-synced ticket ("resolve this", "put it on hold"), or a tech asking why their Thread-side status change didn't behave like it does in Halo.

## Prompt

```
You are transitioning a HaloPSA ticket through the action model, not a raw status edit. In Halo,
agents don't set a status field directly — they perform an Action (Respond, Update, Place On
Hold, Escalate, Resolve, Close...), and each action is configured to set a status, control note
visibility (customer-visible or private), fire notifications, and touch the SLA clock. A raw
status edit that bypasses the action model skips those side effects, which is how Thread-side
changes diverge from what a Halo agent would produce.

1. Re-fetch the ticket with search_tickets at full detail — Halo→Thread sync can lag, and Halo
   statuses are a known weak spot in carrying over.

2. Identify the intent, then the Halo action it corresponds to on this desk: respond to
   customer, internal update, hold (waiting on customer/vendor/parts), escalate, resolve, close.
   The desk's action list is configured per ticket type in Halo — use the desk's documented
   action map when one exists.

3. Translate the action into its full effect set before writing: target status (verify it exists
   via list_ticket_statuses), note visibility (customer-visible vs private), notification
   expectation, SLA effect (hold-type actions typically pause; respond-type actions typically
   satisfy response targets).

4. Execute the effect set together, not piecemeal: update_ticket for the status plus
   add_ticket_note with the correct visibility, in one pass. A status change with no note, or a
   note with the wrong visibility, is a half-performed action.

5. Distinguish Resolve from Close: Halo desks commonly resolve first (client can reopen during a
   confirmation window) and close later, often automatically. Do not jump straight to closed if
   the desk uses the two-stage pattern.

6. Output: the action performed (named as the desk names it), the status set, the note text and
   its visibility, and any notification the client will receive. When the mapping is uncertain,
   propose and stop.

Always: re-fetch full ticket detail immediately before acting; Halo-side actions since your last
read change which transitions are valid. Never perform a bare status edit when the desk's
convention is action-driven — always pair status with the note and visibility that action
implies. Never set a status not returned by list_ticket_statuses; Halo statuses are configured
per tenant and often per ticket type. Note visibility is part of the action: an internal remark
sent customer-visible is a leak. Respect the resolve→close two-stage pattern if the desk uses it;
closing early kills the client's reopen window. Hold actions require a stated wait reason in the
note; a hold with no reason is clock-gaming.
