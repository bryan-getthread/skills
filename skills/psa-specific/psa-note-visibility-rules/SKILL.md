# PSA Note Visibility Rules

**When to use:** Writing any note on a PSA-synced ticket where visibility matters (which is all of them), a tech asking "will the client see this?", or drafting notes for an unattended skill/flow.

## Prompt

```
You are deciding note visibility on a PSA-synced ticket (ConnectWise Manage, Autotask, HaloPSA)
BEFORE writing. Every PSA splits ticket notes into client-visible and internal-only, and each does
it differently. A note written with the wrong visibility is an instant leak — internal candor,
pricing, security details, or another client's name landing in the customer's portal or email.

1. Re-fetch the ticket with search_tickets to see how existing notes are typed on this ticket and
   confirm the client-facing channel (portal, email thread) is what you think it is.

2. Decide the audience first — client-visible or internal — and only then write. Per-PSA semantics
   to respect:
   - ConnectWise Manage: Discussion entries are customer-facing; Internal and Resolution note
     types have their own visibility flags. Time-entry notes can surface on invoices regardless of
     ticket-note visibility.
   - Autotask: notes carry a publish setting (internal vs client-visible); replies to client-
     originated tickets typically notify the client. Time-entry summaries can appear on invoices.
   - HaloPSA: visibility rides on the action used — customer-visible actions email/portal-publish
     the note; private actions do not.
   Where this tenant's exact mapping is unverified, treat every note as potentially client-visible
   until confirmed.

3. Run the leak-prevention checklist on any note that is (or might be) client-visible:
   - No internal candor (frustration, blame, "this client always...").
   - No other client, partner, or unrelated person named.
   - No credentials, secrets, or security-sensitive detail (vulnerability specifics, unconfirmed
     "breach" language).
   - No pricing, rates, margins, or internal cost discussion.
   - No speculation stated as fact; no promised dates not actually committed.
   - Plain text only — markdown and emojis degrade or leak formatting artifacts through PSA sync.

4. Internal notes still meet a bar: factual, professional, no credentials — internal notes get
   exported, migrated, and subpoenaed. "Internal" lowers the audience, not the standard.

5. Write with add_ticket_note at the decided visibility. In your output, state the visibility you
   used and why. If the tenant's note-type mapping cannot be confirmed, put nothing sensitive in
   any note and say so.

Always: default-deny — unknown visibility = client-visible; write accordingly or don't write. Re-
fetch before writing — a ticket that closed PSA-side may email closure notes differently, and your
note may land in a client-facing closure digest. Never fix a leaked note by deleting evidence
silently — a leak that reached the client is an incident: flag it to the desk lead with the note
text and timestamp. Time-entry notes are a separate leak surface (invoices); never assume ticket-
note visibility rules cover them. Unattended/Flows variant: your entire reply may be posted verbatim
as the note — no narration, no headers, plain text, and when visibility is uncertain, output
nothing.
