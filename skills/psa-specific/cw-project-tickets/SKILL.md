# CW Project Tickets

**When to use:** A ticket on a CW-synced desk smells like project work (install, migration, rollout, multi-visit onsite), a ticket number behaves oddly (statuses that don't match the service board), or a service-desk sweep is about to touch tickets on a project board.

## Prompt

```
You are handling a possible project ticket on a ConnectWise Manage desk. CW splits work between
the Service module (service boards) and the Projects module (projects → phases → project
tickets). Project tickets look like tickets but behave differently: they live on project boards
with their own status workflows, carry project/phase membership, roll time up to project
budgets, and service-desk conventions (SLA clocks, triage, closure QA) mostly don't apply.
Thread's visibility into the Projects module varies by tenant.

1. Re-fetch the ticket with search_tickets at full detail. Check its board against list_boards:
   if the board is one the desk designates as a project board, service-desk rules stop applying
   — say so before doing anything else. If the desk's board list doesn't distinguish, use the
   desk's documented board map; if none exists, ask rather than classify by ticket title.

2. Recognition heuristics (evidence, not proof — always confirm): work quoted or sold rather
   than reported; a phase/project reference in the ticket fields or notes; planned multi-visit
   scheduling; budget-hours language. A service ticket that should be a project (scope creep
   past the desk's project threshold) is a recommendation to management, not a conversion you
   perform — CW-side project creation is human work.

3. Status discipline: project boards have their own status workflows in CW. Pull
   list_ticket_statuses for that board specifically — never reuse service-board statuses.
   Closed-family on a project ticket can mark a phase deliverable complete; treat it as
   deliberate, and confirm before any closed-family move.

4. What Thread sees: state visibility honestly. Phase structure, project budget, remaining
   budget hours, and the project's overall status are generally NOT visible from Thread even
   when project tickets sync. Never state budget burn or phase progress you cannot see; report
   "project-level data not visible from Thread — check the CW Projects module."

5. Time entries: time on project tickets burns project budget. If a tech asks where to log, the
   answer follows the desk's convention (usually: log where the work order lives) — but flag
   that misrouted time distorts both service metrics and project profitability.

6. Sweep protection: when running bulk audits or closure sweeps on a CW desk, exclude project
   boards unless explicitly asked to include them, and say you excluded them. Auto-closing a
   project ticket because it "looks stale" between phases is a classic false positive — project
   tickets legitimately idle between scheduled visits.

7. Drift: Thread↔CW disagreement on a project ticket resolves with CW as master; Thread moves.

8. Output: the classification (service vs project, with evidence), which conventions therefore
   apply, any action proposed with side effects, and an explicit list of what was not visible
   from Thread. Record actions with a plain-text add_ticket_note.

Always: re-fetch full ticket detail immediately before trusting or changing anything; project
tickets get updated CW-side during onsite visits without Thread activity. The PSA is always
master — never reopen or restructure project tickets from Thread to match a Thread-side
impression. Never invent project/phase names, budget figures, or board designations. Never
convert a service ticket into a project (or vice versa) — that is CW-side human work. Exclude
project boards from service-desk bulk operations by default; report capped sweep counts as "at
least N". If this tenant does not sync project tickets into Thread at all, run in advisory mode
— identify the work as likely project-side and hand off; state that limitation. Notes syncing
to CW must be plain text — no markdown, no emojis.
