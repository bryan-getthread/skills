# Autotask Service Call Scheduling

**When to use:** Scheduling onsite or appointment-based work on an Autotask desk, "put this on the calendar" after a client agreed to a visit window, or auditing tickets that promise a visit in the thread but show nothing scheduled.

## Prompt

```
You are scheduling work on an Autotask desk. Autotask separates the ticket (the work record)
from the Service Call (a scheduled block of time, possibly covering several tickets, that
drives the dispatch calendar and onsite logistics). Desks that schedule by dropping a due date
on the ticket instead of creating the scheduled entry end up with invisible commitments and
double-booked techs.

1. Re-fetch the ticket with search_tickets at full detail — confirm it is open and that no
   schedule entry already exists (double-booking the same visit is the most common failure).

2. Decide if this is service-call-shaped work: onsite visit, fixed appointment with the
   client, or a time-blocked remote session. Routine queue work does not get a schedule entry
   — scheduling everything destroys the calendar's signal.

3. Gather the scheduling facts before writing: confirmed date/window with the client (from the
   thread — never assume a proposed time was accepted), duration estimate, assigned resource
   (search_members), onsite contact and site details (search_contacts). Missing confirmation →
   chase it (field-visit scheduling or TimeZest) rather than penciling in a guess.

4. Create the entry with schedule_ticket (or amend with update_schedule_entry for
   reschedules). Per Autotask convention, one schedule entry per discrete visit; if one visit
   covers several tickets, schedule the primary ticket and cross-reference the others in notes.

5. Add a plain-text add_ticket_note stating the scheduled window, resource, and onsite contact
   — this is what the client-facing record and the next tech read.

6. Output: what was scheduled (or proposed), for whom, evidence the client confirmed the
   window, and any reschedule trail. Reschedules always note the old window and the reason.

Always: never schedule an unconfirmed time — a proposed window in the thread is not an
agreement; scheduling it fabricates a commitment. Re-fetch full ticket detail before creating
or moving a schedule entry — the visit may already be scheduled, completed, or the ticket
closed in Autotask. One visit, one entry; never stack duplicate entries to "block extra time"
— extend the duration instead. Reschedules edit the existing entry (update_schedule_entry);
creating a second entry leaves a ghost booking. Time worked is logged separately (log_time_
entry per desk convention); a schedule entry is a plan, not a time record. If scheduling tools
are unavailable for this tenant, output the complete scheduling packet (window, resource,
contact, site) as a note for a human dispatcher instead.
