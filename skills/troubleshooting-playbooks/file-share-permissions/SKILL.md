# File Share Permissions

Effective access is the intersection of layers — share permissions, NTFS ACLs, inheritance, and the user's group memberships at logon time — and the ticket is always in the layer nobody checked. This playbook ladders them in order and bans the classic bad fixes (Everyone/Full Control, per-user ACL sprinkling).

## When to use

- "<user> gets Access Denied on <share/folder>" (or suddenly lost access)
- "<user> can see a folder they shouldn't" — over-permission reports
- New hire can't reach what their role should reach
- After a migration/reorg, a team's access is inconsistent

## Steps

1. **History first.** search_tickets for this share/folder and this user. A migration, folder move, or "cleanup" ticket in the window is the likely cause (moves within a volume carry ACLs; copies inherit the destination's — a folder that *moved* keeps stale permissions). A recent similar per-user fix suggests the group design is being bypassed — read on to step 6.
2. **Docs second.** search_itglue / search_hudu / search_knowledge_base for the permission design: the group-naming convention (role groups → resource groups → ACLs), which groups grant what on this share, and where the data lives (on-prem NTFS, or SharePoint/cloud — cloud shares follow the sharing-model of that platform; this playbook's NTFS ladder applies to SMB shares).
3. **Pin the failing operation.** Read vs write vs delete vs traverse — "can open the folder but not save" and "can't see the folder at all" are different layers. Get the exact path and the exact error.
4. **Ladder the layers — in this order:**
   1. **Share permissions** — the ceiling for network access. A share granting Read caps everyone at Read regardless of NTFS. Check the share-level grants first; the common design is a broad share grant with NTFS doing the real control — verify which design this client documents.
   2. **NTFS ACLs** — the actual grants on the folder/file. Guide the tech to read the ACL *and compute effective access* for the user (the Effective Access tool exists for exactly this) rather than eyeballing entries. Watch for explicit Deny entries — a single Deny overrides any number of Allows and is the answer to many mystery tickets.
   3. **Inheritance** — broken/blocked inheritance mid-tree explains "has access to the parent but not this subfolder." Check whether the folder inherits, and whether someone disabled inheritance during a past fix (they usually did). Re-enabling inheritance can *widen* access — review what would flow down before flipping it.
   4. **Group membership and the token** — the user's memberships versus what the ACL grants; nested groups included. Freshness matters: membership changes only land in the user's token at next logon — "I was added an hour ago and it still fails" is fixed by logoff/logon (or lock the workstation for Kerberos refresh per current guidance), not more ACL edits. AD replication lag between DCs adds the same false-negative — check before re-fixing.
5. **Diagnose over-permission the same way, reversed.** For "shouldn't see this": find which grant admits them (effective access names the group), then fix the membership or the grant — and treat unexplained broad grants (Everyone, Domain Users, Authenticated Users on sensitive paths) as findings to report, not just this ticket's fix.
6. **Fix with least privilege, through the design.** The correct fix is almost always group membership: add the user to the documented role/resource group. Per-user ACL entries are the anti-pattern that created this mess — refuse them unless the client's design has no fitting group, and then flag the design gap. Verify authority before granting: access changes to sensitive shares (HR, finance, exec) need the data owner's/manager's confirmation per the client's practice — request it rather than assuming the ticket itself is authorization.
7. **Verify and note.** The user performs the exact failing operation after a fresh logon. Plain-text note: layer identified, effective-access evidence, fix (which group, whose authorization), any findings (Deny entries, broken inheritance, broad grants) flagged for follow-up.

## Guardrails

- Never grant Everyone/Authenticated Users/Full Control to make a ticket go away — least privilege through the documented group design, and flag it when no design exists.
- Authorization before access: membership adds to sensitive resources require the data owner or manager sign-off per client practice — the ticket request alone is not consent.
- Deny entries, inheritance flips, and bulk ACL changes are high-blast-radius: review what changes downstream before recommending, and prefer the narrowest change that fixes the pinned operation.
- Remember token freshness — verify after logoff/logon before concluding a correct fix "didn't work" and stacking more grants.
- No remote execution — ACL reads and changes are performed by the tech; this playbook supplies the ladder and gates.
- Over-permission discoveries are security findings: report them to the client contact per practice rather than silently tightening (business processes may depend on the hole — but it gets decided, not ignored).
- Docs tools vary per tenant — note when no permission design is documented; that absence is itself the follow-up.
