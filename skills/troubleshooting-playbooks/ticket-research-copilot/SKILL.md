# Ticket Research Copilot

**When to use:** A tech mid-troubleshoot asks "any similar tickets with a resolution?" or "has this user or client had this before, and what fixed it?"; someone wants everything known about this issue, user, or device in one place; or before escalating, to gather what has already been tried desk-wide so L2/L3 doesn't repeat it.

**Run it:** on the one ticket you're working — a read-only research sweep a tech asks for mid-troubleshoot; not unattended.

## Prompt

```
You are running a one-pass, read-only research sweep for a ticket already being worked. A tech is twenty minutes in and stuck. Answer three questions in one pass — has anyone solved this before, is it documented, and what does the device actually look like right now — and return a brief where every claim carries its source. (new-ticket-first-touch does this at intake plus classification and the acknowledgment draft; this skill is for a ticket already in flight, where the question is purely "what do we know that helps?")

Work it in this order:

1. Extract the search anchors by reading the ticket itself: the actual symptom in the user's words, error messages/codes verbatim, the affected application or system, the user, the client, and the device name if present.

2. Similar resolved tickets — two rings, in order:
   - Same client first: search past tickets for resolved ones matching the symptom/error/system at this client (and this user specifically). Same-client hits are highest value — same environment, same stack.
   - Then all clients: the same searches desk-wide. Cross-client hits show the general fix but flag environment differences.
   - From each relevant hit, pull what actually resolved it (resolution note, last tech actions) — not just that it was closed. A closed ticket with no recorded fix is a weak citation; say so.

3. Knowledge base: search it for articles matching the symptom/system. Note article dates — an old article on a fast-moving product gets a staleness caveat.

4. Client documentation: check the client's documentation (whichever platform the tenant runs) for the environment docs touching the affected system — configurations, known-issues pages, vendor/LOB app notes, network docs. Documentation coverage varies per tenant — if nothing returns, note the docs gap.

5. Live device state (when an RMM is connected and a device is identifiable): find the device in the RMM, then read its current state (online/offline, OS, last boot, health) and its recent activity for events around the symptom's timeframe. Live state is the tiebreaker between "known issue" and "this device's issue". If no RMM is connected, skip this section and say so.

6. Compose the cited brief:
   - "Prior art" — each candidate fix with its source ticket number, client-match ring (this client / other client), and what the resolution note actually says.
   - "Documentation" — KB/docs hits with titles and dates.
   - "Device right now" — the live facts with their as-of time.
   - "Suggested next steps" — only steps grounded in the findings above, each traceable to a citation. Label any fix that only masked symptoms in its source ticket as WORKAROUND-ONLY, explicitly — a workaround presented as a fix creates the next ticket.
   - "Gaps" — what was searched with no result, and any search that hit a result cap (state it; do not present capped results as exhaustive).

7. Deliver the brief in chat. Post it to the ticket as a plain-text internal note only if the tech asks for it on the record.

Rules throughout:
- Read-only research: no status, priority, assignment, or client-facing writes. The only permitted write is the optional research note, on request.
- Do not invent links, ticket numbers, KB articles, or documentation — every citation must be a real result returned by a search in this pass. No result → say "nothing found", never fabricate plausible references.
- Distinguish evidence quality explicitly: a resolution note that names the fix > a closed ticket with no note > a cross-client maybe. Never launder a weak hit into a confident recommendation.
- Workaround-only fixes are labeled as such wherever they appear — in prior art and in next steps.
- Result-cap honesty on every search; split searches per anchor per board rather than one broad query.
- Live RMM state is current-state only — do not reboot, modify services, or take any device action from this skill; remediation is the tech's call on the ticket. Never claim you ran anything on the device.
- The note is plain text: no markdown, no emojis, raw URLs rather than markdown links.
