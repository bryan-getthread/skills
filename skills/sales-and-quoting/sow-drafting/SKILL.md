# SOW Drafting

**When to use:** "Draft a SOW for the office move work on this ticket"; "turn this project conversation into a scope of work"; or "we're quoting the migration — write up scope, assumptions, exclusions."

**Run it:** on the ticket describing the project — run it manually (not a Flow; it's an internal draft for review).

## Prompt

```
You are drafting a brief, honest scope-of-work from what the tickets actually say: concrete
deliverables, the assumptions the price depends on, explicit exclusions, and a reasoned
T&M-vs-fixed recommendation — ready for the sales owner to price and polish.

1. Gather the source context: read the ticket(s) in full, and check the knowledge base for
   any standard project template or prior SOW the desk keeps. Look up the client.

2. Extract what is actually known: the outcome the client asked for (quote their words where
   useful), environment facts stated in the thread, quantities, sites, deadline drivers.

3. Draft the SOW in five sections, plain language:
   - Objective — one paragraph, the client's outcome.
   - Deliverables — numbered, each verifiable ("X configured and tested", not "assist with
     X").
   - Assumptions — everything the effort estimate depends on that hasn't been verified
     (access provided, counts accurate as stated, work during business hours). Every
     unverified fact from step 2 becomes an assumption, not a silent premise.
   - Exclusions — the adjacent work this SOW does NOT include (the usual scope-creep vectors
     for this project type: end-user training, legacy cleanup, third-party licensing,
     out-of-hours cutover unless listed).
   - Engagement model recommendation — T&M when discovery is incomplete or the environment
     is unknown; fixed when deliverables and counts are verified and the desk has done this
     project type repeatedly. Give the reasoning in 2–3 lines.

4. Leave pricing as placeholders (<rate>, <estimate range>) unless the requester supplies
   figures — effort and price belong to the sales owner.

5. Output the draft in chat and offer to attach it as a plain-text internal note. Hand off:
   note what the sales owner must verify before sending (the assumptions list doubles as
   their checklist).

Guardrails: this is a draft for internal review, never a client-ready contract — no sending,
and no legal terms (liability, warranties, payment terms) invented by the skill. Never state
a contractual conclusion (what the existing agreement covers or excludes) as fact without
citing the agreement evidence — scope boundaries against the current agreement are flagged
for the sales owner. Deliverables come from evidence in the tickets or the requester — do not
pad scope with plausible-sounding items the client never raised, and do not promise outcomes
the thread shows are uncertain. Anything unverified is an assumption in writing — an
assumption silently treated as fact is how fixed-price projects lose money. Sanitize: role
placeholders for client staff; no credentials or internal rates in the SOW body.
