# Quote Preparation

Assemble a structured quote with clearly separated options and the assumptions each price depends on — the analysis and layout done, the pricing authority left with the sales owner.

## When to use

- "Prep a quote for <client>: 1-year vs 3-year on the new firewall."
- "Put together good/better/best options for this backup request."
- "Client asked what the project would cost — structure the quote."

## Steps

1. Establish what's being quoted from the ticket via `search_tickets` (and the SOW if one exists — see SOW Drafting): items/services, quantities, term. Resolve the client with `search_clients` for sizing context (users, sites) stated in tickets.
2. Confirm the option axis with the requester: term options (1-year vs 3-year), tiers (good/better/best), or delivery models (managed vs one-off). Two or three options maximum — more is a menu, not a quote.
3. Build each option with the same structure so they compare cleanly: what's included (line items with quantities), term and renewal behavior, what changes versus the other option(s), and the trade-off in one plain sentence ("lower monthly, longer commitment").
4. Price handling: use figures the requester supplies. Where they ask for market anchors, use `web_search` for public list prices and label every such number "public list price — replace with our cost + margin before this leaves the building". Never invent a discount or commit a multi-year price without the requester giving it.
5. State the assumptions under the options — quantities as of the count date, site/access assumptions, tax/shipping excluded, quote validity window (<n> days placeholder) — anything that, if wrong, changes the price.
6. Output: options table + assumptions + a one-line recommendation with reasoning if the requester wants one. Offer to attach as a plain-text internal note via `add_ticket_note`, and hand off to the sales owner with what they must verify (pricing, margin, approval) before it goes to the client.

## Guardrails

- Drafts only — this skill never sends a quote to a client and never presents its numbers as final pricing. Money-facing documents go out through the sales owner.
- Never state what the client's current agreement covers, or promise contract terms, without citing the agreement evidence — term/renewal claims about the EXISTING relationship are the sales owner's to confirm.
- Every unverified input is a written assumption. Public list prices are labeled as such; margins and internal costs never appear in the client-facing draft body.
- No fabricated SKUs, discounts, or vendor promotions. If an option depends on a vendor program (e.g. trade-in credit), mark it "verify with distributor".
- Keep the comparison honest: don't structure options to make one look artificially bad — the desk's credibility is the long-term asset.
