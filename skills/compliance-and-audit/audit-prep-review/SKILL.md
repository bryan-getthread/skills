# Audit Prep Review

**When to use:** "The audit is in <N> weeks — what's our exposure?"; a compliance owner wants a readiness check against a framework's expectations; or post-remediation, verifying prior findings were actually closed.

**Run it:** across a client's tickets, documentation, and evidence (a pre-audit readiness sweep).

## Prompt

```
The point of audit prep is to find your own gaps before the auditor does. Check the three
places audits go wrong — unresolved prior findings, undocumented or stale documentation, and
evidence past its freshness date — and rank what to fix in the time remaining. This skill
reports; it changes, closes, and backfills nothing. Work it in order:

1. Fix the scope: which client/environment, which framework or audit type, and the audit
   date — the date sets how the findings get ranked (fixable-in-time first).
2. Prior findings sweep: search for the previous audit's findings and their remediation
   tickets. Classify each as closed-with-evidence, closed-without-evidence (a finding in
   itself), in progress, or untouched. Unresolved repeat findings are the worst audit
   outcome available, so they lead the report.
3. Documentation freshness sweep: check the in-scope policies and procedures (in IT Glue and
   the knowledge base) for last-reviewed dates outside the review cycle, owners who have
   left, and procedures that no longer match practice (a documented process the tickets show
   nobody follows is a gap wearing a costume).
4. Evidence freshness sweep: from the ticket record, the last completed access review, the
   last backup-restore test, the last DR exercise, the last incident-response test — each
   with its date and whether it falls inside the framework's expected cadence. Date-stamp
   every check; "recent" is not a date.
5. Open-exceptions sweep: security exceptions, risk acceptances, and change-gate bypasses
   (emergency changes without retroactive documentation, via the
   change-request-prerequisites lens) that an auditor will sample.
6. Output the readiness report: gaps ranked by audit impact and time-to-fix, each with
   evidence of the gap, a suggested owner, and a realistic effort note. Leave it as a
   plain-text note for the compliance owner. Remediation itself is theirs to assign — the
   report recommends, it does not act.

Guardrails — always:
- Report gaps honestly and completely — softening the internal readiness report defeats its
  purpose; the auditor will not soften theirs.
- No silent remediation: this skill changes nothing, closes nothing, and backfills nothing.
  Fabricating or backdating evidence to close a gap is never on the table.
- Absence claims carry search scope and result-cap honesty: "no restore-test ticket found in
  <period> across <boards>."
- Date-stamp every freshness check; the report itself carries its as-of date because
  readiness decays.
- Findings about people's unfinished work go to the compliance owner, not into blame
  narratives — process focus.
