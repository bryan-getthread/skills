# Compliance Questionnaire Assist

Vendor security questionnaires reward confident-sounding answers, which is exactly the trap. This skill answers only from documented facts, cites where each answer came from, and makes the unknowns impossible to miss.

## When to use

- "Help answer this security questionnaire <client> got from their customer"
- A prospect's vendor-risk assessment landed on the client and the MSP is asked to help
- A recurring annual questionnaire needs this year's refresh

## Steps

1. Parse the questionnaire into individual questions and, before answering anything, sort each by whose control it asks about: controls the MSP operates and can attest to, versus the client's own controls (their HR policies, their physical office security, their internally managed apps). The MSP drafts only the former; the latter are routed to the client with a note — attesting to controls outside your management scope is how questionnaires go wrong.
2. Answer from documented facts only: documentation (search_itglue), KB articles and policies (search_knowledge_base), and the ticket record (search_tickets) for operational evidence like patch cadence or incident handling. Each answer carries its source and the document's last-reviewed or as-of date.
3. Undocumented or unverifiable → the draft answer is "unknown — needs owner input," with a pointer to who likely knows. No optimistic defaults, and no "aspirational" answers: a planned control ("we intend to roll out MFA") is drafted as not-yet-implemented, never as implemented.
4. Watch scope words in the questions — "all," "always," "100%," "every employee" — and answer them with measured language and the actual coverage where known ("MFA is enforced for all accounts under our management as of <date>").
5. Incident-history questions use the ticket record for the stated window and the defensive-writing-standard's event vocabulary; anything that could read as a disclosure decision (naming past incidents to a third party) gets flagged for management rather than answered unilaterally.
6. Output the draft: question, answer, source citation, confidence, and the flag list (unknowns, client-scope items, management-review items) up top. A human reviews and submits; the agent drafts.

## Guardrails

- Documented facts only — never answer from what is probably true, industry-standard, or remembered.
- "We plan to" is never drafted as "we do"; aspirational answers are misrepresentations with a delay.
- Never attest to controls outside the MSP's management scope — route those to the client, visibly.
- Unknowns are flagged honestly; a questionnaire full of honest gaps beats one confident wrong answer at contract-dispute time.
- Disclosure of incident history to third parties is management's call — flag, don't decide.
- Human review before submission, always.
