# CSAT Follow-Up Loop

**When to use:** "Did the CSAT go out on this ticket?" / "send the satisfaction survey for these closures", pulling survey responses back onto their tickets, "any detractors this week?", or the delivery step after Ticket QA Review passes a ticket to close.

## Prompt

```
CSAT dies in two places: the survey never goes out, or the response never reaches anyone who acts
on it. Close both gaps — verify the ask, record the answer on the ticket, and make sure a bad
score becomes a same-day conversation instead of a quarterly statistic.

1. Retrieve the closed ticket(s) with search_tickets and check whether a CSAT ask already exists:
   the desk's native CSAT survey fires on close where configured (verify the closure used the
   triggering status), or a survey link was in the client-facing closure message. Never send a
   second ask when one is on record — one ask per closure, ever.

2. If no ask went out and the desk uses the native survey: recommend re-driving the close through
   the triggering status via update_ticket (with confirmation), so the platform sends its survey.

3. If the desk runs its survey on a form tool instead: draft the short client-facing CSAT message
   (thanks, one-line recap, the survey link with the ticket reference). Where the member has
   connected Zapier, Zapier: Typeform "Create Form" variants manage the form, and delivery goes by
   client-facing note (or Zapier: Outlook "Send Email"). Present the draft for approval before
   anything is sent.

4. Pull responses back: check the thread for a native survey result note; for form-based desks,
   Zapier: Typeform "Find Response" filtered by the ticket reference. Match responses to tickets
   only on an explicit reference (ticket number, hidden field, or the respondent's email on that
   ticket) — never by timing coincidence.

5. Record each response on its ticket with add_ticket_note, internal, plain text: score, verbatim
   comment (quoted exactly, never paraphrased into something nicer), response date, and source
   (native survey / form).

6. Flag detractors (bottom-tier score or negative comment): identify the lead or account owner via
   search_members and surface a same-day alert — an internal @mention note on the ticket, and
   where the desk prefers, Zapier: Microsoft Teams "Send Channel Message" to the service channel.
   Include score, comment, client, tech, and the ticket reference. Do NOT draft an apology to the
   client unattended — the detractor conversation is a human's.

7. Output: per-ticket status table (ask sent / response recorded / no response yet / detractor
   flagged) and the response rate for the batch.

Match responses to tickets on explicit references only — a mismatched detractor note on the wrong
client's ticket is a serious error. Detractor handling is escalation, not automation: no automated
client-facing damage control, no auto-reopening. Scores and comments are never fabricated or
estimated for tickets without a response. Zapier steps require the member to have connected the
Zapier MCP; without it, use the native survey path and client-facing notes, and note the
limitation. Notes are plain text, no markdown/emojis; survey messages stay short, friendly, and
localizable.
