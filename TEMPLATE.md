# Short Title Case Name

**When to use:** One or two concrete situations, in the words a tech would actually use.

**Run it:** on one ticket · across all <relevant> tickets · or as a Flow (triggered on <event/condition>).
<!-- Keep only the modes that apply, matching the scope/flow frontmatter. -->

## Prompt

```
The runnable prompt — paste this whole block into Super Magic. Write it in plain, natural
English the way you'd actually talk to the agent: "read the ticket", "change the status to X",
"add an internal note", "draft a reply". Super Magic is native-English — do NOT name internal
tools (never write update_ticket / add_ticket_note; write "change the status" / "leave a note").

One prompt can take several actions in sequence (classify, then set priority, then note).
If the skill can run across many tickets, write it so it works on "this ticket, or each ticket
in the set I point you at". Bake every guardrail inline (confidence gates, show-me-before-send,
when-in-doubt-do-nothing, result-cap honesty, never invent data). If it can run as a Flow, add
a short line for the unattended path.
```
